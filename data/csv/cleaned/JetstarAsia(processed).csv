0,"  Being re-booked on this flight I was not really thrilled by the option given as definitely Lion Air isn’t my favourite airline. One of the reasons is the poor seat-pitch one gets. Must admit I was pleased to get an emergency exit seat, with lots of place to stretch out. Moreover, I was excited to fly on a Boeing 737-900, which is not common (though Lion Air has many of them). With the usual non-existing service (nor offer to sell onboard) I noticed an elevated number of flight attendants.

12,"  Denpasar to Jakarta. Lion air is notorious for late flights with no information. You will not find cheaper tickets and if you are OK with waiting at the airport indefinitely then this airline could be for you! Typically flights accrue delays as the day goes on due to ""operational reasons"" which typically are late accumulated arrivals over the day. The staff is obnoxious about the delays and have heard all complaints from passengers over the years to the point that another one is but a grain of sand on a beach. Lion air, always delayed, always disappointing on everything except the price. The number of times I promised myself to pay the premium to fly anything but lion somehow got beaten again by the stated schedule.",0,denpasar jakarta notorious late flights information find cheaper tickets ok waiting airport indefinitely airline could typically flights accrue delays day goes due operational reasons typically late accumulated arrivals day staff obnoxious delays heard complaints passengers years point another one grain sand beach always delayed always disappointing everything except price number times promised pay premium fly anything somehow got beaten stated schedul

However, Lion Air staff at Jayapura tried to blame missing the connection on me (despite their first flight being an hour late) and insist that I buy a new ticket to Jakarta!

14," Jakarta to Tarakan. Late Is Our Name is what Indonesians I've met call Lion Air. They claim a 70% on time performance score. I fly on them at least once or twice a month because I usually have no other option (like it or not, they have flights to more places than anyone else). How is it that easily 75% of the time I am in the 30% of flights that are late? They invariably claim operational reasons are behind the delays. What this often means is that they give the plane that was scheduled for your flight to another flight that was delayed. That way they can get away with giving passengers some bottled water and a bun for your 2-hour delay instead of forking over 400000 to each passenger who would have been delayed for 4 hours on the other flight (as required by Indonesia's Passengers Bill of Rights law). Before serious penalties are incurred, they will then give someone else's airplane to your flight so that they won't have to pay you any money either. And these switches continue at that airport for hours until they get caught up or the day is finally over.",0,jakarta tarakan late name indonesians ive met call claim time performance score fly least twice month usually option like flights places anyone else easily time flights late invariably claim operational reasons behind delays often means give plane scheduled another delayed way get away giving passengers bottled water bun hour delay instead forking passenger would delayed hours required indonesias passengers bill rights law serious penalties incurred give someone elses airplane wont pay money either switches continue airport hours get caught day fin

16,"  Denpasar to Jakarta. I  picked Lion Air because it was the cheapest of all budget airlines (compared to Air Asia, Citilink, etc). The flight was delayed by 1.5 hour and another 30 minutes delay on flight. Apparently this is a regular thing to happen according to my other flight. The onboard experience was not pleasant. The seatbelt that I have was broken so it couldn’t lock, which is very dangerous. The washroom is not well taken care of. The toilet seat was broken and the soap container was extremely dirty. The flight attendant are ok. The seats are ok. There weren’t any in flight entertainment, only the security procedure pamphlet (if you can find it entertaining, thats good) For the price difference of 20 dollar, it was not worth the flight.

Lion is a budget, no-frills airline, thus, no IFE, no meals but a 20kg luggage allowance is provided free. Flight arrived 10mins behind schedule and it takes another 15mins for the aircraft ladder to arrive for disembarkation as Lion utilises the remote stand for cheaper airport charges.

30," It is expected that Lion Air JT 955 (Lombok to Bali) would be late departure as most Lion Air flights are after midday. The two hour delay ""for operational reasons"" was expected however with no notification of the delay until you reach the airport always makes things frustrating.

There seemed to be no air conditioning and the temperature in the airplane had each of us sweating profusely with most travellers only getting relief from using safety cards to fan themselves. Towards the end of the short flight it did really seem that we were cooking in the aircraft. Relief was only felt when getting outside the back door to get some fresh cool air.

After knowing that I could actually take a flight at the same time I contacted CS again but was told that I had to pay the prevailing charges because they can only change free of charge 1x. The worst was when I tried to file a complaint - instead of assisting - a different rep made issues of semantics - saying I asked the wrong questions - hence I got the wrong answer.

59,"  Lion Air manages to constantly disappoint even when expectations are extremely low after flying with them from time to time the last four years. Planes are often canceled and almost always delayed by hours. Information is scarce and the unfortunate personnel is constantly stressed to make the best of a horribly managed airline. All other airlines in Indonesia are better. At the very least you would expect to get to where you are going, this is not always the case with lion air as they frequently cancels flights, and good luck getting refunds. If they do fly that day you can expect a delay of 1-6 hours. Again forget any compensation (which they are legally required to provide). During this inevitable delay, expect to get zero information. I'd literally go to the counter and ask if the plane will be on time 20 min before and they say yes. When I ask if the plane has arrived yet they do not know, and when they check it's still somewhere else. I then ask when it will arrive to this airport and the staff would then sms or WA the ground staff of the previous airport asking when the plane left. When the plane do arrive at the airport it will have missed any slot it was allocated and get allocated a gate on the other side of the airport.

67,"  Jakarta to Denpasar. After the flight was already 30 minutes delayed, I had to search for information myself, only to find out that there would be a delay of 45 minutes because of ""technical difficulties"". The airline's zero information policy towards its guests is shameful. Passengers are not ""customers"" at Lion Air, but simply ""numbers"". Not even the minimum requirements in the linguistic handling of passengers of other countries are met by the cabin crew. The crew speak a gaping English and can barely communicate with simple sentences. Even though the planes are outwardly standard, the care inside the planes is miserable. The cabin is dirty and more like a citybus instead of an airplane. Departure times are more of a guideline and changed at will, information will not be shared, the airline's constant delays are really ""remarkable"". On the returning our flight should have been 3 hours late without any advance information. It was not until I took a look at the boarding card that there was a different departure time than planned. Asked about the new departure time, the check-in staff member from Lion only commented: ""Yes a new shedule time ... we have technical problems with our aircraft"" ... then it would be better to rebook and return to Jakarta with another airline. As a passenger, I would like to be informed about changes to the timetable, etc. without being asked to do so and not have to do my own research first. There is also no service on board. Unless you pay. Is so far to agree with the pricing policy of the airline, but not that one can not even place his orders in English.

Intransparent baggage policy The scheme is arbitrary - even the call center is obviously not informed. It was not possible to know in advance what the costs are. Very bad customer service. To 5 E-Mail inquiries I received until today no answer. There are several service numbers that no one answers. After the 11th attempt, I finally managed to reach one of the call centers. Unfortunately nobody could help me there any more. The staff can not speak English, but that's not the problem. Even a friend from Indonesia could not get valid information from the airline. For me, that's systematic and deliberate rip-off. The fact that the flight was delayed by more than three hours and we spent a total of 8 hours at the airport is no longer significant. There are many other airlines that are not or only slightly more expensive. Save the ordeal with Thai Lion Air and Bay another flight. DE:  Immens hohe Kosten für aufgegebenes Gepäck.

82,"  Lombok to Jakarta. Missed connection flight in Jakarta because plane delay in Lombok. Staff offered no help to try and catch connection. Doesn't want to compensate fees for missed flight. Says I must go back to Lombok to receive compensation. The only reason why we booked with Lion Air was because we had an emergency situation on our hands. Our original itinerary was to fly Denpasar to Incheon via Kuala Lumpur with Malaysia Airlines. When trying to get to back to Bali from the Gili Isles, our boat was cancelled due to rough seas so we were dropped off on Lombok. With no viable way to catch our flights out of either Denpasar or Kuala Lumpur, decided to book with Lion Air to Jakarta to try and catch a flight to Seoul. After booking, we repeatedly asked the staff if there would be a possibility that this flight would be delayed and their response was no. So we booked a separate connecting flight from Jakarta to Seoul. When it was time to board in Lombok, an announcement says that our flight is delayed 1.5 hours. We ask staff Lion Air staff if there is anything they can do to help us when we land in Jakarta to make sure we get to our connection and they just give us this certificate of delay paper. Fastforward to landing in Jakarta with 20 minutes until our connection leaves, no one seems to want to help us catch it. So we miss our connection and get stuck in Jakarta for 24 hours. Next morning we come back to Lion Air customer service to argue for some sort of compensation and manager tells me that if I want receive compensation for anything I would have to go back to the Lombok lion air desk to get it - same company so I don't see why they can't just handle my case in Jakarta.

For what is about a 25 minute flight from LOP to DPS, they managed to delay a March 9 mid-morning flight by 4 hours for ""operational"" reasons and for a ""runway inspection"" by local authorities. Have never heard that one before. The operational issues seem to start at the top of the organization given that these delays are more the norm than the exception. (Our flight from DPS to LOP was also delayed by an hour.) The cabin crew seem genuinely disinterested and issue only the standard sorry apology but no mention of any kind of compensation or even any food or beverage during the delay. We will never fly them again and will let everybody within earshot know why. This company can't possibly go out of business fast enough.

We asked 30 minutes before the flight was scheduled to take off if there was a delay. Ground crew told us that the flight was ON TIME. However in fact it was delayed by almost 2 hours. We were not advised of any delay until passengers started to ask the ground crew as to what the problem was. We were not offered any refreshments as outlined by the Ministry of Transport. When we asked about refreshments from the ground crew they said - we are preparing the food. However it never arrived. When we asked the crew on the flight - they said the food is not their responsibility. That this always happens that there is a delay but food is never provided because the ground crew are a different group to them. We said the responsibility was Lionair. They tried to explain that Lionair flights are often delayed and therefore it would be very expensive for the airline to provide compensation to all flights, because so many flights are delayed! They then said that they were only the airplane crew and they didn't know if they were late because they never come off the plane! Total lies. Then when they did agree that they we were in fact delayed, they started disagreeing as to how long the delay was. Making up stories about how a delay is calculated. Finally they came to us and said the delay was exactly 1 hour and 52 minutes and that it wasn't delayed by 2 hours.

108,"Most terrible experience and will never fly Lion Air ever again. We booked a return flight from Singapore to Bali via Jakarta and got an email to tell us our flight from Bali to JKT is delayed by an hour which cut our transit time allowance to only 1 hour instead of 2. Initially, we thought even thou rushed, we probably would be able to make it, but we were terribly wrong. When we arrive to JKT, it took us an overpriced cab (airport shuttle never came) and an hour to get from terminal 2 to terminal 3 only to be told by Lion Air staff that maybe we have to go back to terminal 2 to collect our luggage which is total misinformation. They don't even bother to check and they know nothing when you asked them. Thankfully, we did not go back to terminal 2 or else we will probably miss our connecting flight! The Lion Air flight back was even worse. True to what we believe by now, the short 1 hour transit time is definitely not enough. So during our check in at Bali to return to SG, we asked the staff how we can make it within 15 minutes from the flight landing time to the next boarding gate to board at the stipulated time printed on our boarding pass. It is totally impossible. They are not able to give us an answer how they are going to ensure we can make it to the next flight. We had to demand to see the supervisor who told me Icould disagree with the flight changes but that is not true because there is no option I could indicate i disagree with the flight changes and the email about the schedule change only came later after I booked the flight. Finally he said the staff at jkt will be there to fetch us to our connecting flight. And so, flight at Bali was delayed with no information to let the passengers know. We are supposed to board at 3.30pm and we only boarded 2 hours later with no announcements. We had to also change gates for the boarding and again no announcement at all to inform passengers. It was totally chaotic. When we asked if our next connecting flight is delayed since our first leg of flight is delayed and won't reach in time to take the next flight from JKT to SG, Lion Air staff said no which means we will miss the next flight!

That is always a challenge for any airline to get right. My usual airline, AirAsia, does not charge for a wheelchair if arranged up front. Lion charges a whopping 30.00 SGD for a wheelchair. Now my first piece of advice, do not use Lion Air is you need help getting around. I found that the words ""Customer"" and ""Service"" are fairly unknown. Lion is especially bad with that concept. If there was a zero star rating I would readily give them that rating. I am an American, Indonesia extends what is called a ""Visa on Arrival"" to USA and some other countries. When I went to get my boarding pass the Lion Air employee refused to give me a boarding pass because I did not have an Indonesian Visa in my passport.

125,Flying LionAir (operated by Wings Abadi Air) from Bali to Komodo Airport on 7th Oct. What an absolute nightmare! It started 3 days before trying to re-confirm my flight with them as it has been booked 9 months earlier from the  and I had an email advising slight schedule change the day earlier. We arrive at Bali airport to be met with chaos at check in most disorganised airline ever (and I have travelled many times in the Far East and Africa).

The departure time now had passed and it was about an hour past departure time a few flights had been boarded but no news of ours none of the departure boards were working so again I went up for a third time to find out what was happening asked another person to be advised 'Flight Cancelled' and you have to go back to check in. I got the clerk to assist us back to the airline desk and we found out the flight had actually been cancelled the night before they never should have checked us in and took our luggage. The airline were not able to rebook us either on to another flight so we lost our trip to Komodo.

However, I was quite impressed of this airline for several reasons: 1) There was no cancellation or any delay of our two legs with Lion Air. 2) I found the crew very polite, they had a smile on their faces while welcoing passengers during boarding. 3) I was also very impressed witnessing the staff helping passengers actively with storing their big and heavy bags onto overhead bins, this is a touch that you wouldn't see with European crews. 4) Crew engaged in emergency instructions. They briefed passengers in the exit rows about their duties. There was a seat empty on the exit row so a cabin member was asking people if they would like to sit in the exit row. 5) Crew were not good with English skills, their airline magazine also has no english content at all. 6) Price was amazing compared to other carriers.

Online check-in opens 24 hours before the flight and I was able to already select seats for free which was nice. Check-in and baggage drop-off at Denpasar Bali airport was quick. We booked 15kg of baggage, one bag was slightly overweight and I didn't bother too much beforehand. The employee weighed the two bags together and it said 29.2kg so no problem at all. I printed online boarding passes but we got new ones at baggage drop-off. Flight boarded nicely on time, about 10 o'clock before the 10.25 departure time. Pushback was at about 10.30 and takeoff just shortly thereafter. According to schedule, flight-time would be only 55 minutes and landing would be at 10.20 (Java time is one hour before Bali), but we landed at about 10.40. Taxi took only a minute and 10.50 we were waiting inside on our luggage. That took about 15 minutes to appear on the belt, maybe a little long. The flight itself was boring. There is no service available. Flight attendants seemed professional though. The seat was the main letdown. A little filthy and legroom insufficient. Should have been the same 29 inch pitch as on AirAsia but felt tighter. Couldn't keep my legs straight with my 1.92m and had to bend them.

159,"  Singapore to Jakarta. Lion Air has a bad reputation of having delays over and over. And this delay problem happened to me on my flight from SIN to CGK. We were departing at 14.50 and boarding at 14.05.  Not until around 14.30 the plane arrived and passengers are just getting out of it. Meaning that the plane just arrived from another flight. At 14.50 we begun boarding and at 15.15 we were taxiing. After around 30 minutes in to the flight, they put seatbelt on is still on and apparently we were having some turbulence but it's normal. Then the flight attendants offer some food and drink (which is very nice, I ordered the fried rice with ebi katsu). For the cheap price, Lion Air offers a reasonably comfortable seat for me. This is probably because i'm only 165 cm and quite skinny. The plane is quite clean and new although the stickers on the tables was ripped. But the lavatory could use some improvements.

160,"  It was a early morning flight out of KUL. I was in a group of 10 people going to Radin Inten II airport in Bandar Lampung via CGK. There was a 5-hour stopover in CGK before our next flight to TKG. Overall, the flights were pleasant, but in the inflight sales of food was too simple; no food items were available, passengers were only able to buy water and a piece of cake.

There wasn't any inflight entertainment other than some magazines and there wasn't any food menu either. However, they did sell a few main courses, snacks, and drinks. The food was okay.

169,Booked route back in January 24th. Been flying with this airline numerous times before but this was the first international flight. A few hours before my flight I decided to reschedule to Jan 25th due to some inevitable matters in then I tried to call the local customer centre number. I managed to reschedule without much hassles certainly with some additional fees (to be paid at the airport). The following day I checked in at Lion Air kiosk in the airport paid the fees and got my boarding pass. It is evidently cheaper than the infamous low-cost carrier Air Asia in some routes. Also worth noting that being a low cost carrier in Lion Air - unlike Air Asia and several others - remains a few (if not the only one) of its kind to land in satellite terminal means it is accessible more conveniently from City Centre.,1,booked route back january th flying airline numerous times first international hours decided reschedule jan th due inevitable matters tried call local customer centre number managed reschedule without much hassles certainly additional fees paid airport following day checked kiosk airport paid fees got boarding pass evidently cheaper infamous lowcost carrier asia routes also worth noting low cost carrier unlike asia several others remains one kind land satellite terminal means accessible conveniently city centr
170,Have used Lion Air several times on domestic flights. It's a budget airline so cheap prices. Facilities as you'd might expect are quite standard for low cost carrier: no onboard complimentary meals no IFE cramped seat pitch (unless for several seats along the emergency exits) narrow aisles and needless to say chaotic upon boarding and unboarding as it is often full. Flight itself sometimes experiences delays but usually departs and arrives on time. FAs in general are quite friendly.

The seats are not comfortable, as they jam so many people in so the seats feel very cramped. There is also a rush to get overhead baggage as some people carry baggage that should not be taken to cabin at the first place due to their size. There is no inflight entertainment, and some seats don't even have in-flight magazines. The flight is not good, the landing is very rough though the weather is fine. I fly the earliest flight possible, so I don't experience delays that frequent Lion AIr services in Indonesia.",1,jakarta medan service nothing special mention attendants servicing well lack enthusiasm sincerity showing seats comfortable jam many people seats feel cramped also rush get overhead baggage people carry baggage taken cabin first place due size inflight entertainment seats dont even inflight magazines good landing rough though weather fine fly earliest possible dont experience delays frequent services indonesia

Yes, we did have one of Lion Air's notorious delays (about 25 minutes) and no, they did not mention it nor apologize. However, the flight itself was allright. Seats and legroom are comparable to other low-cost airlines and we comfortable enough for me (I'm just under 1.80 m). Staff are friendly and in-flight food and drinks are inexpensive.

Flown with about almost 1.5 hours of delay for the return leg but it is Changi so I won't complain. What I notice about this airline is that they provide more (just a little more) room for International flights. Had no problem fitting in my legs (I am 184cm tall) a little cramped but nothing compared to my last flight. That being mentioned I can't actually say much about the level of comfort that I get from LCCs you get what you pay! Now lowering down my standard to the level of Lion Air is a pleasant airline to fly with. What they can do to improve passenger satisfaction is to improve their punctuality. Lion Air has been the master of all delayed flights and with their new 700 aircraft's in order they can improve their means of operation too.,1,flown airon respectively using rather new single isle boeing flown almost hours delay return leg changi wont complain notice airline provide little room international flights problem fitting legs cm tall little cramped nothing compared last mentioned cant actually say much level comfort get lccs get pay lowering standard level pleasant airline fly improve passenger satisfaction improve punctuality master delayed flights new aircrafts order improve means oper

187," The flight from Jakarta to Berau was a mixed bag. The leg from Jakarta to Balikpapan was flown on a B737-900 on Lion Air, which was pretty much on time though the flight was not very comfortable with very limited leg space. However the flight from Balikpapan to Berau was delayed by almost 4 hours which was really irritating since the flight kept getting pushed by an hour at a time. They did give each passenger a compensation of 300,000 for the delay but which did not cover the fact that I had to shell out extra for a hotel room in Tanjung Batu since the connecting boat to Derawan was missed. The flight as such was ok but the next time would prefer to fly Sriwijaya or Garuda despite paying a slight premium.",1,jakarta berau mixed bag leg jakarta balikpapan flown pretty much time though comfortable limited leg space however balikpapan berau delayed almost hours really irritating since kept getting pushed hour time give passenger compensation delay cover fact shell extra hotel room tanjung batu since connecting boat derawan missed ok next time would prefer fly sriwijaya garuda despite paying slight premium

We flew from Berau to Balikpapan on a ATR 72-500 of Wings Air which was quite comfortable since I got a first row seat and was thankfully on time since there is nothing to do at Berau airport. The check in process was smooth and hassle free. The Balikpapan to Jakarta leg was delayed almost 2 hours, thankfully I had planned a long gap before international connection to Mumbai (to Singapore).

190,"  Singapore - Jakarta in early October on Lion Air. First impressions count, and Lion Air didn't deliver on most counts. What's the point of sending an email asking passengers to web check-in when the facility doesn't work? At the airport the handling agents weren't very friendly but I give them credit for ensuring a speedy boarding of the flight. On board is where the fun begins. Cabin crew were busy talking amongst themselves instead of greeting passengers. Apparently they don't seem to be interested in keeping the plane clean, as I found some wrappers lying on my assigned seat. Then the cherry to top the cake: ""this is flight to Jakarta, could passengers please check their boarding passes to ensure if they are on the right flight."" First time I've heard that in my life. I suppose that is probably due to personnel mistakes made at Indonesian airports, which really makes me seriously wonder how this airline operates. On the plus side, the ticket was the cheapest among all the low-cost airlines, and my flight departed on time and arrived early in Jakarta. But that was about it. I can't say the seats were very comfortable, nor the inflight beverage bar service fantastic (they don't even have menus in the seat pockets). If I had to fly them I'd do so if I have no choice. Otherwise I'd feel much more at ease if I can fly an airline that has better service and proper safety standards.",1,singapore jakarta early october first impressions count didnt deliver counts whats point sending email asking passengers web checkin facility doesnt work airport handling agents werent friendly give credit ensuring speedy boarding board fun begins cabin crew busy talking amongst instead greeting passengers apparently dont seem interested keeping plane clean found wrappers lying assigned seat cherry top cake jakarta could passengers please check boarding passes ensure right first time ive heard life suppose probably due personnel mistakes made indonesian airports really makes seriously wonder airline operates plus side ticket cheapest among lowcost airlines departed time arrived early jakarta cant say seats comfortable inflight beverage bar service fantastic dont even menus seat pockets fly id choice otherwise id feel much ease fly airline better service proper safety standard
191," I have almost every week flown Lion Air from Jakarta to Singapore, taking the first flight out. Experience begins from check-in where there is always a queue and have to wait long for your turn. (This is likely where the delays originate). The aircraft is parked at the apron and a bus will take you there from the gate, usually a short distance away. During boarding, the FA never checks boarding passes. Seats are poor in legroom and cramped. Since this is a budget airline, there is no IFE, simple F+B can be purchased. Cleanliness can be poor at times as there are uncleared rubbish in the seat pocket. The picture shows a very hazy view out of the window with lots of dust stuck between the panes. On the other hand, FAs are polite and nice, sometimes too nice or perhaps slightly lax to ensure safety on board is adhered to. However, fares are cheap and one can't complain much for that price. Just bring along a good book or a neck pillow and snooze.",1,almost every week flown jakarta singapore taking first experience begins checkin always queue wait long turn likely delays originate aircraft parked apron bus take gate usually short distance away boarding fa never checks boarding passes seats poor legroom cramped since budget airline ife simple fb purchased cleanliness poor times uncleared rubbish seat pocket picture shows hazy view window lots dust stuck panes hand fas polite nice sometimes nice perhaps slightly lax ensure safety board adhered however fares cheap one cant complain much price bring along good book neck pillow snooz

Returning flight at 12am was delayed for 2 hours ground staff provided mini dinner snack box which most passengers left untouched. Delay was informed upon check in. Cabin crew pleasant call button answered almost immediately drinks requests tended to quickly. The major difference between Lion and the rest of the budget carriers is that they do not hawk duty free sales so once meal service is completed passengers are left undisturbed. Both flights not completely full despite the very attractive fares. One reason could be due to the bad publicity Indonesian carriers have been receiving.
