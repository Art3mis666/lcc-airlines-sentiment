Our flight is from Phnom Penh to Colombo via Kuala Lumpur (self check-in in KL). It only gave me itinerary for the flight from Phnom Penh to Kuala Lumpur and only for one traveler, altough there are two of us. While trying to manage our booking, the booking confirmation was sent to a weird and suspicious e-mail and my contact number was removed and changed into a Chinese phone number. After I changed this strange e-mail to my e-mail address, I received the booking confirmation in Chinese only.

6,"  I book premium flatbed to and from KUL-Taipei, I spent over RM8000 for my wife and my tickets. We leave KUL on Christmas eve. The flight have been delayed first from 10 am to 1:30 and the gate was changed from one site of the large airport to the other side of the airport, we are asked to checked in but was usher to another room for more waiting. The flight finally left around 2:30-3:00 Pm for Taipei. At least we still have the flatbed seat we book to relax on the flight. Later on the return trip, the flight was delayed, and during checked in I realised the seat number are not consistent with my booking, so i asked the ground crew about it and was told not to worry as i still have my seat I booked .. it is a lie. We were shocked when we walk into the cabin as the configuration of the plane is different from our booking. there are no flatbed on this plane, up until now, no one have the decency to let me know about this changes. Later during the flight I asked one of the stewardess how to request for a refund for my premium flatbed booking and was told i need to make an online feedback on their website. I make the feedback after on the 3rd day after returning to KL and I didn't receive any email or message reply. last i check i have a RM400+ credit in my account which i assume is from that flight but i am not sure as i never received any response.

Out of curiosity, we did an online search and we saw AirAsia still have other flights available from KL to Bangkok on 12/24/2022, but with higher ticket price, so we contact AirAsia support via chat and tell them that we have to be in Bangkok on 12/24 for our vacation activities and hoped they could re-schedule us to the same day flights. To our surprise, the support staff were not helpful at all by keeping on saying ""no, we don't have any seat available for flights on 12/24"".

Had to wait for an hour of 200 people queuing, when it finally my chance, I wrote my inquiries and they just disconnected without answer. It happened TWICE.

16,"  I like Air Asia for been a good low cost airlines. But when you have an issue, the problem are starting and you will find nobody at the end for a solution or at least an answer. Air Asia changed the flight schedule by 5 hours and this was not compatible with my holidays. So I asked for a refund on Dec 2. On Dec 16, I went through the long and inefficient talk with robot AVA until I get in the queue for a human agent with n°90. After an hour, I got an answer: your refund will be done in 2 days. On Dec 20, after playing again with AVA for half an hour, I was granted to the queue with number 144. And after 2 questions, the chat was terminated by the agent or ? and I still not get and answer. But every time the claim case was solved. I guess this is a great satisfaction for Air Asia to close claims, without answering their customer. In fact AVA was better than the agent, but both are inefficient. So I gave up with AVA, and called the phone voicemail service for Air Asia Thailand. I explained my case and  after 24 hours still waiting for a call back when it should have been done in 24 hours. But for urgent case I can contact AVA: joke. Form this experience, I notice that the customer service at Air Asia is non-existent, but also when you consider the price of the ticket (must check everything: seat, luggage, food), Air Asia is no more advantageous compare to a normal airlines like Malaysia Airlines or Thai. And for a small difference of the fare you can talk to a real agent instead of a stupid robot and incompetent agents.

After addressing this to the staff, you're just referred back to the kiosk and after insisting it won't work, finally being referred to a counter to drop off your luggage. At waiting your turn at the counter, the completely uninterested ground staff member simple wanted to refer me back to the kiosk again even after i've stated it didn't work.

35,"  I went to my gate entrance for my domestic flight at 2.15 when my flight is at 2.50. At the time, when the officer scanned my boarding pass the machine said ""not checked in"" even thought I clearly had the boarding pass. The officer said to try again in 5 minutes and the same result kept coming up until 15 minutes had passed and now the result became ""too late to board"". The officer told me to go to the service counter and they kept sending me to different service counters until I reached the rudest lady who initially told me that I can't board within 20 minutes of take off, even though I was at the gate 35 minutes before take off. I kept begging her to help me but all she said was ""please step aside, sir. I'm busy"". That was 5 minutes prior to the supposed take off and of course I missed the flight.

But when i went to the airport it was not reflected on the system and they said I was not checked in and as such cannot check in anymore as counter is closed. The only solution was to buy a new air ticket.

41,"  I ordered my round-way tickets months in advance, only for them to say my return flight will be canceled one week before the actual flight. I needed to talk to someone to get more detail about the process, but no human is available as their system is now only a bot.  The system offered to move my return flight to another day but none of the proposed timing fit my schedule, so I asked for a refund. I was given a pending case confirmation, without any detail whatsoever on the refund processing.  Since I couldn’t get any clarity, I decided to go down to the airport counter and asked some questions to the ground staff at the AirAsia counter.  She checked and confirmed the refund request was actually for both depart and return tickets, something that is not made clear in the bot chat. The ground staff could not void my refund request as this has to be done by AirAsia and not the airport staff. I had thought that the refund was only going to be for my return ticket but I had lost both tickets. Because of this, they couldn’t guarantee that I will still have my name in the booking system on my departure date. The ground staff said there’s nothing that can be done on their side as they have no way to reach AirAsia. Basically, I need to book another ticket which is way more expensive now that I have so little time left before my flight. So before you book your tickets think twice. It could just be a stroke of bad luck on my side, but I’m reading so many reviews that are similar to mine and they help solidify why I will never book from this airline ever again.",0,ordered roundway tickets months advance say return canceled one week actual needed talk someone get detail process human available system bot system offered move return another day none proposed timing fit schedule asked refund given pending case confirmation without detail whatsoever refund processing since couldnt get clarity decided go airport counter asked questions ground staff airasia counter checked confirmed refund request actually depart return tickets something made clear bot chat ground staff could void refund request done airasia airport staff thought refund going return ticket lost tickets couldnt guarantee still name booking system departure date ground staff said theres nothing done side way reach airasia basically need book another ticket way expensive little time left book tickets think twice could stroke bad luck side im reading many reviews similar mine help solidify never book airline ev

49,"  Purchased baggage in advance with tickets. Tried to luggage drop exactly an hour before flight time at 11.25am which was stated as 12.25pm. System error stating late. Went to the counter, and was told to queue. Spoke to a couple of other passengers and noticed they are the same flight as me, and machine also stated late and hence unable to luggage drop despite them being there way earlier than 1hr before departure. When queue reaches our turn, its 11.45pm. Counter customer service stated too late, cannot luggage drop. We were told to wait for this flight to depart first, then try to request customer service for change to another flight and pay the difference. That sounds ridiculous because the other passengers are ""late"" because AirAsia's own ticketing system has a problem and everyone was asked to queue until they missed the closing time for dropping luggage. I gave my luggage to my wife who drove me here and ran all the way to the departure gate. I arrived at the departure gate at 12.10pm. On the way, custom informed me that system shows I cannot board but I can try. Tried I did. To my surprise, the plane is not there yet at the departure gate when I arrived. This means Airaasia could have helped, but they simply refuse. When I tried to reason to the counter at the departure gate, all I get told was I was late. There is no sense of logic in the heads of these customer service agents. In any case, it is now 1.25pm whilst typing this review. 60 minutes delayed with no notice on estimated delay duration. There are the elderly, and kids here and they just don't seem to be bothered. When queried what is the policy for flight delay and possible cancellation, he says 2 hours first, then denies saying it back and forth. Very unprofessional and unreliable customer service.

They have no interest in attempting to retain a customer in any way shape or form, the default answer is no.

68," I travelled in Thailand with AirAsia, and this time was my worst experience ever. First, they cancelled my flight 3 times. Every time it was a few days before the flight, it cost me more than $300. They've always refused to refund me. You have to know that when you want to get a refund, no ""real customer service"". You can chat with a bot (which is totally dysfunctional) that always repeats the same garbage. Many people have been waiting for more than one year, never saw they money back. Second, some of their practices are very dubious. When I booked my flight, it was written ""check bag included"".

All other flights - different airlines - have refunded our money.

Note: it was explicitly stated that we had to reply within 7 days, which is odd as AirAsia does not reply to us at all. I have been trying to get in touch with an actual human-being for over a year now. Facebook, website chat, WhatsApp, all you get is AVA the chat bot. I provide them with my case number, my personal details and all I get is 'I am sorry, we could not find your details in our system', which is complete lies.

77,"  Flight for March 2020 was changed and they offered us a refund which we accepted. Wasn’t a cancelled flight to do with covid or anything. It’s now been three months since I gave my bank details and was told my refund was validated and still don’t have the money back, 15 months since the flight. Also since this point it has been impossible to speak to a human being. Emails sent to addresses we once got replies on are being ignored, they have stopped responding to Twitter DMs. Their chatbot is the biggest waste of time and energy. It eventually gives you a choice to provide feedback and that someone will contact you back during work hours only for you to fill it all out and then be told it cannot be completed due to overwhelming volume. When we check the case status it says in progress despite being told it was validated in March 2021. Other airlines refunded within weeks. We’ve been waiting 15 months. I will never fly with Air Asia for as long as I live. When we were getting responses from “customer service representatives” we were met with hostility or else overly polite apologies which mean absolutely nothing to people such as us who are left out of pocket.

After a couple of glitches involving the bot, it finally found my records and transferred the refund to my member ""credit account.""

134," Tagbilaran to Manila. AirAsia is extremely gimmicky and unprofessional! I've flown with very many different airlines for almost 40 years now and I've never ever experienced such unprofessional treatment. They are the only airline that counts your personal/cosmetic bag as part of carry-on baggage weight. However, they only selectively enforce this policy so that makes them utterly unprofessional. I chose to fly with AirAsia for the first time because they had the cheapest cost for my round trip from Manila to Tagbilaran/Panglao, Bohol in the Philippines. On the Manila, to Tagbilaran flight, my carry-on baggage and personal/cosmetic bag were not even checked or weighed at all, but on my flight back the customer service agent chose to enforce their stupid policy and made me pay an extra baggage fee. The worst part about this experience was that I was made to open and repackage my personal/cosmetic bag, carry-on bag, and checked baggage while I was at the check in counter. I was struggling to get the weight just right for them and a security guard noticed me struggling and whispered to me to just take out my laptop from my carry-on baggage because then AirAsia won't count it as carry-on weight if I only take out my laptop and carry it by hand. It's so damn ridiculous! Why didn't the customer service agent just tell me this and save me money, time, embarrassment, and frustration in the first place? Why did she make me go through all that trouble and money and time wasted? I also asked this customer service agent to let me speak with the manager and she just kept telling me ""ok"" or ""they're busy right now."" I also noticed that very few other passengers were made to weigh both their carry-on and personal/cosmetic bags as I were. This horrible airline is the worst airline I've ever flown on in my almost 40 years of flying all over the world on so many other different airlines and I will never ever fly with this joke of an ""airline"" ever again.

141,"  Hanoi to Denpasar via Kuala Lumpur. Customer service could not have been more unhelpful.

Every time we tried to rectify the issue we were issued a new agent and new complaint number and had to start from scratch every time. In the end, they said they were working to applying it towards our flight but it could also be used to pay for baggage. Of course the problem was never resolved, so we assumed we could at least check our baggage using our credits. Wrong. Apparently there is no systemic connection between the people at the air Asia counter and the customer service people online. The people at the counter were unhelpful at best. Ultimately, the customer service online system and the physical counter at airasia are somehow not linked. Very advanced system! We were told we had to request online 4 hours in advanced of the flight to use the credits towards our baggage. Of course this was not mentioned by customer service online.

I showed then the damage the seat had done to my knees after take off and they just did not care. I watched them throw a lady out of the extra legroom seat who was trying to breastfeed a baby, this is how uncaring they are.

I would understand the expectation to pay some kind of a fee for updating the flight destination, but the fact that they don't even offer it as an option is an extreme inconvenience.

170," Kuala Lumpur to Singapore. AirAsia is known with low-cost fare, but does it mean Low cost = no service? Other than Low-cost fare, Air Asia well known with flight delay, flight rescheduled, poor customer service. It happens regularly that the flight rescheduled on every single flight. Other than the Air Asia low price on promotion is attractive, you'll not surprise if you heard any bad feedback comment about how AA disappointing customer. I'm not the first one and I believe will not be the last one. How AA Customers support system fooling customer around? It must be a platform to train your patience. AA customer support system has 4 ways to contact Air Asia which are Live chat (24/7), call centre, Twitter(24/7) and e-form. I have tried 4 of them: Live chat (24/7): it has been removed - 26 Dec 2018 URL No Longer Exists You have to wait for average 1 hour on live chat queue to say hi to a live chat staff. If you miss the screen when the conversation started, you will kick out from the chatroom by livechat staff, when you check back the screen, it showed ""thank you for contacted live chat"". You have to wait for another one hour. Live chat staff could simply end your conversation without your notice, so even your question not yet finish,you will be kicked out by the staff again. Call centre: I have called to call centre from Malaysia at RM2 per minute! I wanted to buy/add-on/upgrade my baggage to 25kg (3 days before my flight), but it is no longer available on ""modify"" at the airasia homepage. The only way is you have to call them (yes waste time + money), otherwise it would me RM45/kg (not sure they increase the price or not) at the check-in counter. waiting time: generally 10 minutes. Twitter (24/7) the so-called ""24/7"" Twitter service is totally a lie. You can tweet them 24/7, but they will only reply to you immediately, most of the time a few hours or few days. (tweet them for 5 months due to my lost bag case). When the staff is free they will tell you Please wait for the investigation or there's not much they can do, please contact live chat/call/e-form. Live chat, twitter and call centre will push all the responsibility to e-form. Ask you to contact e form. E-form has annoyed and wasted my time the most. It took few days/about 1 month to reply to you, they could just reply sorry that they have done their best and simply closed the case straight after. I've created the same case for 3 times because the staff closed my case without solving my problem, but it is written in the email that my case has been solved, or you didn't reply the email within 7 days. Here comes the tactic: at first you can still contact the AA staffs, but after 3-4 emails, suddenly your reply cannot reach to the AA support team and this will end up case closed because the system shows that you didnt reply to the AA email. When you reply, a no reply email message will tell you that your case has closed, if you need any assistant, please send an e form again! I strongly advise you be aware when you book the AA ticket. The price is really attractive, but please make sure you add on all the bag, meal etc. For the locals, I suggest you check also the price from Malaysia Airlines, Fireflyz and Malindo.",0,kuala lumpur singapore airasia known lowcost fare mean low cost service lowcost fare air asia well known delay rescheduled poor customer service happens regularly rescheduled every single air asia low price promotion attractive youll surprise heard bad feedback comment disappointing customer im first one believe last one customers support system fooling customer around must platform train patience customer support system ways contact air asia live chat call centre twitter eform tried live chat removed dec url longer exists wait average hour live chat queue say hi live chat staff miss screen conversation started kick chatroom livechat staff check back screen showed thank contacted live chat wait another one hour live chat staff could simply end conversation without notice even question yet finishyou kicked staff call centre called call centre malaysia rm per minute wanted buyaddonupgrade baggage kg days longer available modify airasia homepage way call yes waste time money otherwise would rmkg sure increase price checkin counter waiting time generally minutes twitter socalled twitter service totally lie tweet reply immediately time hours days tweet months due lost bag case staff free tell please wait investigation theres much please contact live chatcalleform live chat twitter call centre push responsibility eform ask contact e form eform annoyed wasted time took daysabout month reply could reply sorry done best simply closed case straight ive created case times staff closed case without solving problem written email case solved didnt reply email within days comes tactic first still contact staffs emails suddenly reply cannot reach support team end case closed system shows didnt reply email reply reply email message tell case closed need assistant please send e form strongly advise aware book ticket price really attractive please make sure add bag meal etc locals suggest check also price malaysia airlines fireflyz malindo

It wouldn't bother me until they told me my flight would delay to 14:35 on 30 March. I called to confirm and they told my flight was still the same time. As soon as I arrived KUL airport, I found my flight delayed to 14:35, then I asked them to move my flight to the 12:00 one, they refused my ask cause I didn't change it 48 hours ago according their policy. They changed my flight within 48 hours and ask me to make a change before 48 hours?!

205,"  My wife and I just returned from a trip to the Maldives on flights FD 177 and FD 178 (Bangkok – Male) on 26 Oct and 31 Oct and I must say they were the worst flights we have ever experienced. We paid extra for the Premium Flex package. To start things off, we thought the flight would depart from the International terminal at Don Muang airport. The only thing departing there was the long bus ride from the far northern end of the airport to the extreme southern end where the plane was parked. A few meters more and we would have boarded from Ram Intra Rd. The plane then taxied back to the far north for take-off. Why couldn’t a concourse gate be used? While inflight we expected to get our pre-ordered meals which were ordered when the flights were booked in April. No way. Instead we were given a bland rice dish instead with no explanation as to why and a small bottle of water. On arrival in Male our express handling of baggage was anything but. I counted nearly 40 bags of normal baggage before our luggage appeared on the belt. So much for “express handling”. The departure from Male on 178 was delayed by the late arrival of 177 from BKK. Why a turnaround flight originating in BKK should be late (first and only flight) is beyond comprehension unless it was mechanical, but then no explanation for the delay was ever given to the passengers. It finally departed for BKK 1 ½ hours late (14.05 vs 12.35). In addition, there was no priority seating except that we were able to get on the bus first followed by remaining passengers on the flight until the bus was full. And again we were given the same rice dish we got on the outbound flight. This time we argued with the attendants about failure to provide what was ordered. One of them had the guts to tell us that ""This is what you ordered"". I told her it was not what we ordered and that Air Asia thinks it can serve premium customers whatever it (Air Asia) wants. Cash customers got what they ordered. We refused to eat that rice and my wife had to pay to get a drink and a candy bar to eat and drink. My wife overheard 2 attendants saying that at least 10 pre-ordered meals were not provided to people on that flight. Arrival in BKK again put us in a closed down section of the airport (old domestic terminal parking bays) and again bussed to the northern end of the airport. Again, no priority – everyone (136 passengers) were crammed into one bus at the top the terminal. So I ask you, would you put up with this type of service when paying premium fares for so-called better service?

They won't even provide an escalation process if unhappy with their ruling. Unfair and unjust. Small seating - the seats are too small for taller people. I hate that.

On the first 2 flights, the staff were unfriendly. On the last flight the staff were friendly but seemed exasperated by all of the requests of passengers. Carry on bags should be only 7 kilos but only one airport weighed our bags and made us repack them. There is no unity among the airline. Every airport has a different request. AirAsia is cheap because they offer you no amenities included in the price. Checked bags, food, and drinks are all an extra cost. Passengers may order food and drinks and pay cash on the plane but it was not an organized system. People were crowding the aisles and shouting at the crew to get what they wanted.

217, Ho Chi Minh City to Sydney via Kuala Lumpur with AirAsia. I have to say this was the worst travel experience I have had. We bought our fares through an online booking service rather than the airline. On the way there it was bought as one package i.e. one flight to Sydney via Kuala Lumpur then connecting flight to Ho Chi Minh City and we also bought a package of 2 flights for the way back the exact same way online. When arriving at Sydney no problem for the airline staff to print us both boarding passes for the Kuala Lumpur flight and also the Ho Chi Minh City flight at the same time. On the way back different story. They said that these were two separate flight bookings that our online booking service had made for us. So in KL we then had to go through all their security and customs and then check our bags again and this took us about 1.5 hours. Many times I have brought my own decaf coffee with me on the plane as airlines never serve decaf coffee and I don't drink caffeine. I usually just ask them if I can have a cup of boiling water with some milk and I add my own decaf coffee.  I got told by a very nice air hostess that she would give me the hot water and milk (powdered) for free and that if I asked on another flight for this that I might be told to pay for a drink. There is no in flight entertainment and meals are not free as a low-cost airline. When you  pay for a meal on the plane you must pay in Malaysian currency or credit card. Then if you don't have credit card you can't purchase anything.

219,"  I first bought the upgrade pass in 2015 via Air Asia site and I purchased 6 upgrades to business class for more than the amount if you go directly to optiontown and request a non guaranteed upgrade but I thought the guaranteed one was worth the extra money. I simply had to directly book a business class seat. Then in 2016 when my pass expired I again went on the AirAsia site and purchased another 6 upgrades. What they didn't state clearly is that the pass no longer guarantees an upgrade, in fact it is useless as you are required to book an economy seat and then go onto the optiontown site and request an upgrade. So you pay a higher price and you have almost no chance of getting an upgrade. This is because Air Asia has already sold a huge number of these passes and has already obtained that money. So then if any business class seats are left, they heavily discount them. So for my new upgrade pass I received no upgrades. I even went on line and saw that there was only 1 business class seat left on a flight and although I had the pass, I paid the heavily discounted extra price of $800 so I could receive the seat.

220," AirAsia offer four flights a day to Singapore from Bali Indonesia. Unfortunately it is difficult to rely on any flight time as they have started consolidating flights to fill planes. My booking for the earliest flight was to allow time to take my daughter to Singapore for her 21st birthday. First flight in, last flight out would give us 12 hours in singapore. 2 days before the flight to Singapore AirAsia resheduled it, ok fair enough, it was only by 2 hours. But then 6 hours before the flight they rescheduled it again by 3 hours. Then to add insult to injury the rescheduled flight was also delayed by 50 minutes. We finally got to Singapore but our entire whole day shopping trip turned into only 3 hours. Why offer such an extensive array of flights you have no intention to fulfil?

221," Surat Thani to Kuala Lumpur. AirAsia has to be one of the all around worst airlines I have ever flown. I don't write reviews, this is the first. I travel internationally a lot and am used to difficult situations and bad service. It takes a little effort to get me annoyed. Their website doesn't work very well. It constantly kicks you off. The website won't take any of my Visa cards. Because of this, I am forced to purchase tickets thru a 3rd party such as orbitz with the same cards where purchasing add ones such as baggage is not always an option. Some flights include a checked bag, others don't. So, if their website doesn't work and you can't pay in advance, you are left with getting ripped off at the airport on your bag fees. Inflight service is rude and narrow minded. For example, I booked meal service for a flight in February 2017 from Bangkok to Hanoi. I ordered a coffee in advance, however, after traveling all night, I decided to forgoe the coffee and sleep instead. I asked for a water and was told ""no, you must have coffee because it is what you ordered."" I said ""okay, I'll pay for the water"". Staff gave me an annoyed look and pushed the cart away. I was not rude, I was not demanding, but was treated very poorly. I ended up having to flag down another attendant and ask for a water. This was not an isolated incident. Similar things have happened to me before and I seen it happen to many others. Maybe my expectations are to blame here because of where I come from, but the capacity for abstract thought seems to be lacking within this organization. Being kind, courteous and compassionate is not a hard thing. Unfortunately, there is no recourse for me. They don't care. They are so big, it will be hard to avoid them in the future, but I'll will do my best to use other airlines.",0,surat thani kuala lumpur airasia one around worst airlines ever flown dont write reviews first travel internationally lot used difficult situations bad service takes little effort get annoyed website doesnt work well constantly kicks website wont take visa cards forced purchase tickets thru rd party orbitz cards purchasing add ones baggage always option flights include checked bag others dont website doesnt work cant pay advance left getting ripped airport bag fees inflight service rude narrow minded example booked meal service february bangkok hanoi ordered coffee advance however traveling night decided forgoe coffee sleep instead asked water told must coffee ordered said okay ill pay water staff gave annoyed look pushed cart away rude demanding treated poorly ended flag another attendant ask water isolated incident similar things happened seen happen many others maybe expectations blame come capacity abstract thought seems lacking within organization kind courteous compassionate hard thing unfortunately recourse dont care big hard avoid future ill best use airlin

I booked and realised that I had the wrong date, it was the 22nd and not the 23rd. Okay, I should have seen this but I didn't. It may even have been the sites fault as I am so careful booking. I noticed this within seconds after the confirmation came in. I tried to call and after a wait of over 100 minutes, the call was answered. I was cut off by their agent. Infuriating and an absolute disgrace and contempt for their passenger. A wait of this length says it all about their attitude. Wait long enough so you hang up? The problem then goes away? I emailed 6 weeks ago and am still waiting for a reply. I had to book again and lose the first flight for both of us. Why do AirAsia not allow minor changes within a set time, say 12/24 hours?

227,"  Chengdu to Denpasar via Kuala Lumpur. Most ridiculous flight I've ever experienced. Flying with two adults, an infant on lap and a two year old child. At airport early and possible to check baggage through to final destination, but couldn't print boarding cards or check in for second leg of flight. At transfer desk as soon as landed and five plus hours before second flight but still given three seats each several rows apart - including our two year old. Told that this was within policy since we had not paid extra to reserve seats together and there was nothing they could do but we could ask at the gate. Did that and told nothing they could do but should ask on board. On board told no, that was the policy and we couldn't change seats. Obviously not feasible to leave a two year old five rows away from nearest parent for a three hour flight, finally agreed could ask other passenger's if they'd mind swapping. Couldn't wait at front of plane or on bridge until everyone else had boarded though as that would delay boarding - he'd have to sit on his own until everyone else was in their seats and then we could try to swap if there was time before take off. In case you haven't met a two year old, getting him to sit next to strangers in a strange place with no parents in sight is unlikely to work and I imagine you'd probably get arrested for child cruelty in some countries. Eventually simply picked two random empty seats next to each other and pleaded with passengers to swap who thankfully took pity on us. Will not be flying Air Asia again, am amazed that their policy of two year olds sitting on their own is even legal.",0,chengdu denpasar via kuala lumpur ridiculous ive ever experienced flying two adults infant lap two year old child airport early possible check baggage final destination couldnt print boarding cards check second leg transfer desk soon landed five plus hours second still given three seats several rows apart including two year old told within policy since paid extra reserve seats together nothing could could ask gate told nothing could ask board board told policy couldnt change seats obviously feasible leave two year old five rows away nearest parent three hour finally agreed could ask passengers theyd mind swapping couldnt wait front plane bridge everyone else boarded though would delay boarding hed sit everyone else seats could try swap time take case havent met two year old getting sit next strangers strange place parents sight unlikely work imagine youd probably get arrested child cruelty countries eventually simply picked two random empty seats next pleaded passengers swap thankfully took pity us flying air asia amazed policy two year olds sitting even leg
228,"  I'm reviewing a booking, not an actual flight: I booked Denpasar - Manila on 15/11/2016, with a 2 hour transit at KL. Some days afterwards I received an e-mail from AirAsia saying the flight from Denpasar / KL was rescheduled leaving me 10 minutes between flights. There were 2 links: One for a telephone number which I called and whose lady said she couldn't help. Another for a chat that was consistently unavailable for 2 days. Also a e-form, which I used twice, but with no answer. The email itself couldn't be answered. After several tries on at least two days and two hours (in total) waiting, I managed to contact the live chat. I found out they would keep my money at least one month, if I'd cancel and ask for a refund. I had to search for alternative flights myself,on AirAsia website while chatting - they didn't help on any regard. In between, the chat was timed-out. So I had to wait again and managed to change the flight to the only option that allowed me to arrive on time at Manila. That forced me to stay overnight at KL. AirAsia didn't offer any compensation for that.

I made a booking for a flight and because the credit card interface did not work, I allowed them to debit my bank account for a ticket. The booking number is even mentioned in the bank account statement but they never sent a ticket. As I had to fly for business trip, I was booking the same flight on the same date again and paid with credit card (this time, it worked).  The customer is providing proof of double payment on the same day, is even giving the booking number of the flight where he did not receive a ticket and providing all information needed for a refund.

KLIA is a very large airport and I was unable to make the cut off in that short duration to board the connecting flight. AirAsia took that as a no-show and made me pay 74 Singapore dollars as a ""change fee"" to board the next available connecting flight. Terrible on the part of Air Asia for doing this.

We boarded the flight which was scheduled to depart at 5.25 pm but due to some technical reasons they returned from the runway and had to change the plane at the last moment. As a result the flight got delayed by almost 3 hours. Next surprise was that they did not offer complementary food considering everybody was just sitting in the plane for 3 hours. When some of us asked the reply was that they are not carrying sufficient food for everyone. The crew was inexperienced. They had no idea about how to handle the situation. I think Air Asia should focus on the quality of services before expanding their network.,0,air asia india traveled delhi bangalore may rd one worst experiences boarded scheduled depart pm due technical reasons returned runway change plane last moment result got delayed almost hours next surprise offer complementary food considering everybody sitting plane hours us asked reply carrying sufficient food everyone crew inexperienced idea handle situation think air asia focus quality services expanding network

250,My flight was from Sydney to Kuala Lumpur on 30 March 2015 at 11.55am. At about 10.30am we were told the flight would leave 2.5 hours late. (We didn't board until after 3pm). Many of us would miss connecting flights I was told that I would be informed about my new connection in Kuala Lumpur. We arrived just after 9pm we handed our boarding passes and were told to wait. After an hour we were given boarding passes for our next flights and were told we had to collect our baggage to go to a hotel. We waited for an hour with our luggage then went through immigration and customs and left the airport to wait for a bus to our hotel. After midnight some of us started to realise that the promised hotel rooms were non-existent and went inside to be in the air conditioning. (We hadn't had food or water served for about five hours by this time.) One staff member yelled at people who were reluctant to leave again to wait for the hotel bus and security were called when one passenger started to complain loudly. A group of passengers were taken to a hotel and returned to our group outside the airport after an hour because they couldn't get them rooms. AirAsia staff then left us. I for example waited 12 hours outside the airport with all my luggage; I had no Malaysian currency to buy food because I was only in transit. No one offered me a food or drink voucher and not one AirAsia staff member apologised. Apparently this level of service is acceptable. I would never book with them again as it's a false economy: you might save a few dollars upfront but if something goes wrong AirAsia takes no corporate responsibility and you are on your own.,0,sydney kuala lumpur march told would leave hours late didnt board pm many us would miss connecting flights told would informed new connection kuala lumpur arrived pm handed boarding passes told wait hour given boarding passes next flights told collect baggage go hotel waited hour luggage went immigration customs left airport wait bus hotel midnight us started realise promised hotel rooms nonexistent went inside air conditioning hadnt food water served five hours time one staff member yelled people reluctant leave wait hotel bus security called one passenger started complain loudly group passengers taken hotel returned group outside airport hour couldnt get rooms airasia staff left us example waited hours outside airport luggage malaysian currency buy food transit one offered food drink voucher one airasia staff member apologised apparently level service acceptable would never book false economy might save dollars upfront something goes wrong airasia takes corporate respons
251,As I write this my wife is trying to get home from Bali. They promoted their new direct flight from Melbourne to Bali late last year which we booked only to be told two days before departure that they never had authorisation for that route. As a result she had to travel through KL and this added an extra 8 hours to her trip. They promised that the issue of the direct flight would be fixed before her return trip and guess what. Another text two days before she returns home saying that she is going through KL again. Then the morning of coming home the Flight to KL was cancelled and she was put on an earlier flight meaning she had to leave her hotel in a mad rush at 4am to get to the airport. In total it will now take her 16 hours to get from Bali to Melbourne with this joke of a so called airline. Add to that the customer service is poor the planes are dirty and they promise things they have no intention of delivering.

253,"We flew from Denpasar to Perth yesterday and will never fly this airline again. We checked in several hours before our flight and were disappointed to find that we had been given seats in two different rows (my husband and I were flying with our two kids). Obviously we had hoped to sit together as a family but thought ""oh well it's not the end of the world"". We boarded the plane and realised that we were not only in different rows but in 4 different seats. We were absolutely gob-smacked that an airline could put a 2 year old on his own! When we waved down the air hostess and explained that our son who had just turned two could not sit on his own she told us that the flight was full and we would have to take our dedicated seats. I told her that our 2 year old could not possibly sit on his own and she suggested that he sit on my lap instead. Pretty disappointing when you paid for 4 seats. Just when I thought things couldn't get much worse the food trolley came around and after placing my order for a hot meal for myself and my two kids I was told that they only accept cash and not card. I didn't have any cash on me (I had actually tried to withdraw cash at the airport but the ATM was out of order) so they told me I was unable to order any food. I said that there must be some other option as my kids were hungry and surely there was something they could do but they did not help at all. My poor kids basically spent the whole flight crying with hunger and they wouldn't even give me a bottle of water (as our water had been taken off us at the airport by security). I was basically in tears by this time and finally a kind passenger gave me $10 so I could buy something for the kids to eat.

255,Boarding was delayed 2 hours because of the incoming flight. This was ok we received vouchers. We boarded the airplane and just after the safety instructions we where informed that there was a problem with an engine. So we waited a further hour when we were informed that we had to disembark. So about 300 passengers left the airport received a coupon and started to queue at the 1 shop to get some food. After an hour of queuing the shop stopped serving claiming that they had run out of food and that we had to go to the other side of security zone to get some food. So we where directed to another queue which turned out to lead to a security check which took away all the fluids that we had bought and returned us exactly where we had started. We queued again to the shop. After an hour the police came and said we had to vacate the area. In both cases an Air Asia representative should have taken the trouble to inform us of what was going on. So then we had a further 3 queues each taking more than an our to pass passport control get hotel vouchers and board busses. Air Asia obviously does not care about our holiday time because if they had they would have canceled the flight earlier so that at least the passengers could spend an afternoon outside of the airport.

There was no one at the AirAsia departure lounge counter so I went to the check in counter and asked staff what our flight status was.

As you can imagine after spending over 3hours waiting for the flight and being told that my comfort kit was not available I was mighty ticked. I know that there are circumstances that flight will be delayed and I understand that but the lack of communication given to customers was poor.

262,"Yesterday I flew from Thailand to Malaysia. Air Asia charges extra for every possible option. I booked a ""hot seat"" which should have priority boarding. No priority was ever offered and I was stuck in a mad rush of people to get on the plane. I also pre-booked food. I saw the flight attendants bring food to several passengers around me but passed by me with the food cart. I had to call the flight attendant with the button and only after my boarding pass was inspected was my food served. The portion was inadequate to say the least. The bathroom was out of soap and when I again used the call button to get out of sight flight attendant's attention she explained that there had been many flight segments and that the soap had run out. No apology was offered although she did suggest I use the bathroom in the back. Trying to explain that the airplane should be serviced at every stop regardless of how many flight segments there are in a day was useless and she felt it was not her or the airline's fault that there was no soap. After about 45 minutes the entire flight crew went to the back of the plane and closed the curtain while they read the newspaper and chatted. No one was in the front of the aircraft until landing.

So on a domestic flight from Phuket to Bangkok instead of $330 baht per bag (about $10-11 US per bag) we had to pay a whopping $900 per bag (about $30 US per bag!) and it was their fault that we couldn't follow their procedure to check-in and pre-pay online. If you are sick (like I was) on the flight don't expect an air sickness bag in the pocket at your seat nor a blanket you have to buy the blanket. The flight was chaotic!

270,It isn't low cost there are additions to the fares such as seat selection fee baggage fee meal fee and other hidden fees which all adds to and cost as near as a decent airlines like Thai Airways. Their services from ground to in-flight staff were inefficient. KOL-HKT 5 of us were travelling including my 2 year old daughter. Bangkok- Phuket being a short haul flight I skipped the seat selection (my biggest mistake). I told the lady at the check- in counter that we required 3 seats together minutes later our luggage was through and we were handed the boarding passes. All 5 of us were placed at different seats far from each other. Upon boarding I wasn't going to sit down until 3 of us were seated next to each other. A stewardess found 3 passengers who felt sorry for our situation and swapped seats. I saw their so called hot seats for which you pay extras for extra leg room were not any different from those ordinary seats. The seats were so cramped that you can hardly move if the seat in front was reclined back. Air Asia can change their flight timings anytime they want so stay tuned and updated. Our flight was postponed nearly 24 hrs.They claimed that they did try to contact me. At the sales desk we were told to wait an hour and see if there were any no shows. There were so we rushed to check-in luggage through and then told that there are only four seats left and we must hold the baby in our lap. We had no choice rushed to the aircraft as the last call was announced. We struggled just like before with the separated seats even though this time I had pre-selected seats with the original flight. We also had pre-booked meals with the original flight but since we boarded on a different flight they wouldn't serve us any meal. Air Asia in Bangkok lands at Don Muang Airport and not the Suvarnabhumi. The difference in two is that the Don Muang airport is an old airport and later is a new one.

271,I have traveled this airline twice. While their inflight service is average I found other aspects to be quite awful. I travel extensively across US Europe and Asia so have a good basis of comparison. If there is a problem - don't expect any competent problem solving. Ground staff are poorly trained and unhelpful in case of a problem. First time I traveled my flight from Phuket to Bangkok was delayed several hours and they had no idea when the flight was going to depart or even which gate it would depart from. On a recent flight from Siem Reap to Denpasar via Kuala Lumpur several transit passengers had to be offloaded because they could not transit through KL - you need to enter the country and then exit via immigration so those from countries requiring visas were not able to board. They have no transit facilities at their hub in KL. The website clearly states they have through transit facilities - to this the passengers were told by the ground staff manager that the website is frequently incorrect and cannot be relied on. So that is the other problem - their website is unreliable and not kept current by their own admission. which in this day and age is totally unacceptable. Their terminal in KL is awful - it makes a Greyhound bus terminal seem sophisticated and comfortable. There is no place to sit and its bursting at the seams with passengers. If you have a long stopover be prepared to stand around or sit on the floor or on your bag. There is little to eat or drink until after you go past immigration to the gate but you can't check in to your flight until 2 hours before departure - so if you have a long break between flights you better come equipped. I have taken my last flight on AirAsia - it is truly the worst airline I have flown.

277,Flew from Bangkok (BKK) to Jakarta (CGK) on 27th June this year 2012. Paid for the trip by credit card now you have pay for the processing of the transaction. Every small thing is an extra now! The check in was fine but that was where it went downhill. Got to the gate 30 mins before boarding time and waited and waited the incoming aircraft had not even arrived yet. After another hour still no aircraft. What was totally unacceptable was the fact there was no announcement and no-one seemed to know what was happening I even suggested they call flight operations but they didn't.

304," Bali to Mumbai. My flight supposed to depart at 03.10pm, on 31 March. They allowed passengers to check in at 11.00 am but didn't inform them about the delay. Once the immigration process was completed, then they changed departure time to 07.00pm. Now passengers don't have any option other than waiting. There wasn't any AirAsia executive present at the gate. We also didn't get any vegetarian food at Bali Airport. The airline provided food as it was delayed, but they ordered Non-Vegetarian food only. They should have some common sense that Non-Vegetarian people can eat Vegetarian food, but Vegetarian people cannot eat Non-Vegetarian food. Most of the co passengers were absolutely frustrated. They promised us that they would provide Vegetarian food on the flight. But when flight departed they told us that you have to buy it. I really will not recommend this AirAsia to anyone. While going to Bali from Mumbai, one flight attendant told me that currency exchange rate with AirAsia is different. Generally 1 INR = 210 IDR(app). But with Air Asia, 1 INR = 100 IDR. That was so pathetic. I wanted to choose twin seats while web checkin. The Customer support misguided me. They told me there wasn't any twin seats available in flight so I ended up booking different seats paying equal amount. And actually twin seats were there. This airline is bearable for those whose height is less than 165 Centimeters and a journey of max 3 hours. I will not travel via Air Asia again even if they provide me free tickets. I will not target the inflight entertainment and seating comfort as it is a low cost carrier. We should not expect more from it. It is just a plane which have seats with little cushion onto it.

To save time, let me first list the positives of my flights and then the problem areas. Positives: No delays. Flight arrivals were timely. Unloading was fast. Wifi was available for free. Problems: No staff acknowledgement getting on the plane to any passengers. Did not have Malaysian currency (coming from Vietnam) and was not allowed to pay by credit card so that I could have a bottle of water! Cue tip in the seat pocket from previous flight. Decor is most budget I have seen, carpet does not cover the whole floor of the plane and the stains/tears in the leather seating is obvious. Staff (not all) lacked a positive attitude toward the passengers. The rest is what you would expect from a budget airline i.e. tight, uncomfortable seating, no in-flight entertainment, no complimentary food/beverages, complimentary wifi was limited, no power supply, etc. This is a classic point A to point B service, which was delivered.

On the return leg from KUL to SGN, whilst boarding I was pulled out of line, both the old and new passports taken off me (which I eventually demanded back). The staff checking boarding passes was suspicious of anyone handing her a smartphone boarding pass. What's the point of using the AirAsia App if we get dirty looks when using it for storing boarding passes? Anyway, her supervisor contacted his supervisor using WhatsApp then after sending pictures of my passports to him, I was finally allowed to board.

Showed my boarding pass on my phone, that was all fine, and then they gave me a paper boarding pass. While boarding, I showed my boarding pass on my phone, as I had put my paper boarding pass away, they acted like I was from another world having a boarding pass on my phone. They took me out of line, saying paper boarding pass all taking my pasport out of my hands.

312," Shantou to Bangkok. With my knowledge having boarded AirAsia I simply lowered my expectation of inflight service to zero. Beautiful flight attendants were there greeting me. The plane took off as scheduled. The meal plan I pre-booked is served at a comfortable pace. They were using 2 flight attendants, one is to do everything and another is just to stand there and hand out the food. I have no idea whether it is the best way of serving on board but I see many flight attendants who are serving passengers more actively. They refused my Chinese money once I ordered a can of coke. I have given them 14RMB, the flight attendant returned me with 2RMB and said it is too old. As a passenger I can't the control or reject the legal money given to me from a supermarket, can I?

316,"  I bought a ticket Padang - Kuala Lumpur in february 2017 for a flight in August. With this flight we had 6 hours in Kuala Lumpur to catch the other flight. After a month I a got a message of a reschedule for about two hours later. It still should be enough for the transfer in Kuala Lumpur. On the day of departure when we arrived at the ariport a next reschedule of the flight. This means about two hours for transer. This is very tight for a transer in Kuala Lumpur, due to the two different terminals. We informed the AirAsia staff, they arranged a Priority luggage handling. The man took a picture of our passport and ticket and send it to Kuala Lumpur to inform the office there and probably inform the Oman Air counter, our connecting carrier. Finally, at the gate we waited for three hours to found out that the flight was delayd for almost an hour! The plane had a fast and smooth trip to Kuala Lumpur. At arrival we ran to the luggage band, picked up our luggage as first and run to the next terminal. At the second terminal we found out that the connecting flight of Oman-Air has left already.  The result was that I had to buy 4 new tickets to Amsterdam. Back home filling in the e-form and ask for help or compensation. But the only response of Air Asia, sorry we are not responsible. We can not be charged for costs due to delay or rescheduling. This means that you cannot trust AirAsia if you have a connecting flight. If you cannot trust the schedule you better don't fly with AirAsia.  Im sorry because the flight and onboard service is okay.

317,"  I was travelling from Bali to Hong Kong, where I had to transfer at KL. I only had a cabin size suitcase, and a drawstring backpack with me. I have been travelling with AirAsia many times in the past, due to the it's competitive price, even though the seats are uncomfortable, but I don't mind it for short hauls. I have always been using the same cabin size suitcase when travelling with them. So size wise, I know my suitcase is definitely fine. For my drawstring backpack, anyone who has one knows you can't really put much in it. I only had my personal documents in the bag, plus a jacket to use while on the flight. After I finished checking in, a guy stopped me and wanted to weigh my luggage. The total weight of my 2 pieces were just slightly over 10kg (the total permitted weight is 7kg for AirAsia). This is exactly what I came with, perhaps less. I threw away an old top and flip flops after this trip too. They weighed my luggage on my outward flights, I can't remember the total weight for that, but they let me through, but gave me a little advice to make sure I was within limit the next time. However, on my return flight, this guy did not let me through, he took my boarding pass away, even when I told him I was running late, I only had less than 10min left before boarding time! He said I had to check in my suitcase. So I had to quickly rearrange things in my suitcase again! After all this messing around, my suitcase was finally ready for checking it, and I was charged IDR 800k for that! My flight was only IDR 1,380,400! I could have pay a little bit more, and flew with Cathay, which comes with 20kg check-in luggage, a much comfier journey with entertainment, plus direct flight. What really annoyed me was that after I went to the other side at the boarding gate, I saw so many people with over-sized luggage. I spoke to 2 staff there to make a complaint, but they ignored me. As soon as I landed, I sent an email to AirAsia to make this complaint, there were a lot of emails back and forth, but they were not willing to do anything about it. I'm fine if they want to follow their rules strictly, but please make sure it's consistent.

335,November 26th Chiang Mai to Hong Kong. Early morning flight (departure time 06.00) and while the standard check- in for international flights is 3 hours prior to departure time the counter failed to be staffed until 04.20. A small irritant yes but it was a harbinger of things to come. Ticketing and luggage handling pretty typical of any other airlines with the exception of dealing with excess baggage. Each bag is weighed and there is no leeway whatsoever. Every increment of one kilo was billed as excess baggage. They do not make this easy. The passenger must leave the queue walk across the terminal to the Air Asia cashier process the necessary transaction and then return to the ticket agent to complete the process. We knew we had excess weight we had pre-purchased an additional 20 kilos of sporting equipment. The agent unilaterally decided that trekking equipment was not sporting equipment therefore it was to be classified as excess baggage. We were forced to pay an additional 5575 baht (approximately 175.00 USD) simply based on his arbitrary determination. We pre-ordered and prepaid for an inflight meal. Their idea of a breakfast meal is a small tin of rice or noodles and a 4 oz. cup of water. It was the worst attempt at a meal I have ever witnessed. On this trip we used 10 different airlines. Did Air Asia get us to Hong Kong on time? Yes. Was the plane clean? Yes. Did we receive value for the money spent? Not even close. Of all the airline companies we flew was AirAsia at least average? Not even close! Would we ever fly this company again knowing now how they treat their customers?

336,Unpleasant Experience - flying with toddler with Air Asia. I flew with my wife and 4-year-old son from Jakarta to Singapore on 12 Sep 2014. Surprisingly three of us were assigned to three different seats in three different rows. I asked the check-in counter officer to change the seats. However he said that the flight was full and suggested I purchase seats in advance on my next flights. Some thoughts on this incident: 1) Is this Air Asia business model? Separating a toddler from his/her parents could PUSH the parents to purchase seats on the next flight. This is shown as an ads on AirAsia magazine. 2) Is safety Air Asia's concern? Separating a toddler from his/her parents raises a safety risk. Suppose an emergency event occurs. Who will help the toddler? Do you think a stranger sitting next to him/her would help him/her? Finally I exchanged seats with other passengers. This definitely causes unpleasant for them.

The savings would be 'significant'. So today I did just that. Only problem - when it came to registering the bag the website froze me out - even after multiple attempts. Simply couldn't register the bag let alone pay a lower fee for it. When we got to the airport I explained the situation. We had checked in online so it was clear I wasn't pulling anyone's leg about trying to get things done on the website. But the check in person gave me the cow in a pasture stare and charged me full freight for the bag again. I explained again it wasn't my fault - I'd tried to do what her colleague had recommended - but their website wasn't working. I then told my story to the person who took my money. Same look.

347,I was going from Chiang Mai to Bangkok and had a connecting flight from there to Copenhagen. I had nearly 6 hours to reach the connecting flight. Less than a week before going they cancelled the flight and rebooked me in a new one nearly 3 hours later. However this flight was delayed and I was too late to reach my flight. That meant I had to pay for rebooking and stay nearly 24 hours in the airport. I made a complaint to Air Asia but they would not pay because the delay was less than 2 hours. They could not see it as their problem that I was delayed more than 4 hours because of the rescheduling.,0,going chiang mai bangkok connecting copenhagen nearly hours reach connecting less week going cancelled rebooked new one nearly hours later however delayed late reach meant pay rebooking stay nearly hours airport made complaint air asia would pay delay less hours could see problem delayed hours reschedul
348,The joy that was AirAsia 10 years ago when I started flying with them is no more! On my last flight the problems were so bad I'm convinced this is no longer the way for me to fly even if its on a budget airline. I've already checked in and only needed to arrive early at the airport and then drop my luggage. Unfortunately for me the AirAsia check in system was down. This resulted in very long queues and after 40 long and uncomfortable minutes they resorted to manually check-in passengers and their luggage. While all that is happening they constantly announced about the failure and asked for patience but they continued calling passengers to board flights as if everything else is working. By the time I heard the boarding announcement for my flight we were still hopelessly stuck in the queue. When I approached a ground staff I was horrified to find out that the flight was to take off as scheduled! After at least 1 hour+ of delays thanks to their own check in system's outage I had to remind AirAsia's ground staff that we weren't late because of our own doing. Finally after some frantic phone calls and after realizing at least 50% of the flight passengers are still stuck in queues waiting to check in or to drop their luggage they agreed to delay the flight by 1 hour. Also if you have to board or disembark in KL's LCCT terminal when it's raining I think you will feel very differently about AirAsia - the experience is nothing short of horrible for passengers.,0,joy airasia years ago started flying last problems bad im convinced longer way fly even budget airline ive already checked needed arrive early airport drop luggage unfortunately airasia check system resulted long queues long uncomfortable minutes resorted manually checkin passengers luggage happening constantly announced failure asked patience continued calling passengers board flights everything else working time heard boarding announcement still hopelessly stuck queue approached ground staff horrified find take scheduled least hour delays thanks check systems outage remind airasias ground staff werent late finally frantic phone calls realizing least passengers still stuck queues waiting check drop luggage agreed delay hour also board disembark kls lcct terminal raining think feel differently airasia experience nothing short horrible passeng
349,We flew from SGN-BKK return in June 2012. I flew Air Asia ten years ago and found it was a fun inexpensive airline. How things have changed! It seems Air Asia is now all about squeezing as much money as possible out of the unsuspecting passenger. I can understand budget airlines charging more for the extra space of exit row seats but to charge you $11 extra because you have a medical condition that requires an aisle seat so you can walk during the flight or the same treatment to a passenger with motion-sickness being denied a window seat is a blatant rip-off. Your seat is selected randomly by a computer and if you don't like it then you pay $11 to change it. In Bangkok I tried to call Air Asia’s office 3 times but each call dropped out while I was waiting to speak to someone. The old 10kg baggage allowance has been reduced to 7 kg. (My carry-on wheeled backpack weighs 3kg) so that means I can pack not much more than my toiletries bag and a change of underwear before I exceed the weight limit. If you book on-line checked baggage fees and insurance are added unless you “uncheck” them. Boarding in BKK was a case of “first rush first aboard”. The flight itself was fine but the entire Air Asia experience leaves a lot to be desired.,0,flew sgnbkk return june flew air asia ten years ago found fun inexpensive airline things changed seems air asia squeezing much money possible unsuspecting passenger understand budget airlines charging extra space exit row seats charge extra medical condition requires aisle seat walk treatment passenger motionsickness denied window seat blatant ripoff seat selected randomly computer dont like pay change bangkok tried call air asias office times call dropped waiting speak someone old kg baggage allowance reduced kg carryon wheeled backpack weighs kg means pack much toiletries bag change underwear exceed weight limit book online checked baggage fees insurance added unless uncheck boarding bkk case first rush first aboard fine entire air asia experience leaves lot desir

Eventually they did and they gave us our boarding passes. I  asked if we were all sat together and the check in agent clearly said yes. It wasn't until we got to immigration and i was asked to show our boarding passes when i saw they had my 2 year old daughter sat in a different row to my wife and I. This was very frustrating as it also happened on my flight from Singapore to Kota Kinabalu where the  check in staff told me i had to pay them if we wanted to sit together. I challenged the way the seats were allocated in Singapore to be told that it wasnt anything to do with them it was a computer who allocated seats. Clearly the computer doesn't have a family or doesn't want to sit with its family if it ever travels.

On the flight from Kota Kinabalu to Singapore i had to speak to the gate agent who helped us find seats together.

We were unaware that checked luggage was not included in the ticket price and as a a result we had to pay 72USD each on the spot to have our bags put on the plane.

386,"Phuket to Penang and the flight from Phuket to KL was fine. Get to connecting gate on time and there's no staff there to unlock the waiting area so people are sitting in the corridor on the floor waiting 20 minutes for staff to show up. Staff finally show up and the wait begins. People are expecting to board but we wait. After about 15 minutes I walk up to the gate desk and confirm that the flight is delayed. About ten minutes after this, someone at the desk gets the bright idea of actually proactively communicating this info to the rest of the passengers over the PA. We are given a boarding time of 7:25PM.  I leave and come back at 7:20 and we're still not boarding 10 minutes later. I ask again if the flight is going to be further delayed and I am told that 7:45 is the new time. I began to watch the customer service performance of the lady working the desk and I become amazed at how much basic training in customer service the staff are lacking. She gives no information until people come up and ask what time the flight is leaving. People wouldn't have been getting upset had they just had this basic info communicated to them. This way, people can make arrangements for their pickups from the airport, arrange a late check in etc. Pretty basic stuff. All told, this lady allowed 12 people to get so ticked off that they came up and angrily asked what was going on. She gave them all the same reply she gave to me, but it blew my mind that she never once picked up the PA and told everyone. She wasn't doing anything else really.

387,"I bought a premium flex ticket KUL-DPS-KUL, due to depart KUL at 1820. The afternoon I was leaving London to get to KUL I received a message advising the flight had been rescheduled to a 1405 departure time! (4hrs 15mins earlier). My flight from London was due to land at 1520 so there was no way I would make it. Because of the time change, I had to call AirAsia in Indonesia and explained the situation. There was a later flight (showing available online) departing at 2020 and asked to be moved on to that. Was put on hold for a long time to be advised they would have to charge me to do that and that I should try at KUL airport to change for free. Upon arrival in KL, the later flight was full and was advised I was rebooked at 1030 the next morning. Also flew DPS-KUL-LGK - had to wait 45 mins for bags to arrive in KL and check in again. Air Asia's online system wouldn't let me do KUL-DPS-KUL-LGK-KUL as 1 booking,  so had to make separate bookings, and the handling agent in DPS couldn't thru check my luggage to LGK.

389,I needed to get to Bangkok Chiang Mai and Krabi. To do this within my allotted time span I had no alternative but to fly between these cities. The price differential is quite marked so I elected to try Air Asia which would allow me to compare it with Bangkok Airways who I had flown with before. The aircraft was configured as a single cabin. The first few rows sported cotton covers over the seat headrest and were reserved for passengers willing to pay a premium. The other seats were so close together that for any person over five feet six inches (like myself) were forced into a painful contortion to avoid digging their knees into the seat-back in front. Minutes after the aircraft departed the four cabin crew members wasted no time in blocking the aisles with trolleys flogging drinks and snacks followed quickly by the same four trying their best to get passengers to buy mementoes of Air Asia. My next flight (Chiang Mai to Krabi) due to depart at 12 noon was cancelled. Its replacement was rescheduled to depart at 5.30pm. This meant a totally wasted day for me and meant arriving at my pre-booked hotel at 9pm instead of 3pm. No apologies – no explanations from Air Asia. The only consistency being the aircraft seating configurations and 2 hours of discomfort instead of one. More of the same on my last flight so there is little point in relating it. All in all my experiences were certainly negative ones.,0,needed get bangkok chiang mai krabi within allotted time span alternative fly cities price differential quite marked elected try air asia would allow compare bangkok airways flown aircraft configured single cabin first rows sported cotton covers seat headrest reserved passengers willing pay premium seats close together person five feet six inches like forced painful contortion avoid digging knees seatback front minutes aircraft departed four cabin crew members wasted time blocking aisles trolleys flogging drinks snacks followed quickly four trying best get passengers buy mementoes air asia next chiang mai krabi due depart noon cancelled replacement rescheduled depart pm meant totally wasted day meant arriving prebooked hotel pm instead pm apologies explanations air asia consistency aircraft seating configurations hours discomfort instead one last little point relating experiences certainly negative on

408,"  Flew Sydney to Yangon via Kuala Lumpur. OK, AirAsia is a budget airline, no trouble. Unless you have no money on you and no water, you are in trouble. Everything here has a price ticket, which was absolutely ridiculous on a 13 hour flight: since when do we have to pay for a human right (water). The leg space was so little, that my partner got cramps in his legs (he is nearly 2 meters) and even I (1.65m) was struggling being comfortable. Beside the lack of space, the staff were unfriendly, rude and didn't seem to be interested in their job at all. There was no onboard-entertainement and the check-in at Sydney Airport took nearly 2 hours. Yes, that is correct, we stood 2 hours in line to check in. Another reason why we would not choose AirAsia again is because of the fact that they left the lights on till 1am in the morning, while most people were trying to sleep. This broke us up, as we were so tired but couldn't sleep because of the lights. All in all, we wouldn't fly AirAsia anymore and strongly recommend to show up a few hours before your flight leaves, as the ground-staff were very slow. We had similair problems, a month later when we flew from Yangon to Bangkok: the airplane was a bit late and not cleaned at all. We were boarding the aircraft while the previous passangers hadn't even left the plane! Secondly, because of the lack of legspace, it will most likely be a very uncomfortable flight.

409," I have been using AirAsia since around 2010. I previously had no major problem. However, this time I felt really disappointed with their punctuality. The round trip Jakarta to Singapore, each trip was delayed 45 min to 1 hour. In addition of that, before take off and landing, the crew told the passengers that due to traffic on the airport, the aircraft had to wait for another 15 to 30 min. For me, that just could not be more annoying. AirAsia is no longer a budget flight. The price has gone up tremendously. It is often more expensive than Batik Air, the premium brand of the Lion Air group. Unlike Lion, I hardly heard anyone complaining about Batik problems such as delays. With competitors now offering better options and coming up with new promotions, I think AirAsia may start losing its grip. Check-in now has to be self-service and the early passengers can't choose their seats. It is now randomly assigned.

414,We travelled from Tokyo Narita to Sapporo-Chitose on 22 Dec. Air Asia is the usual low-cost routine - a separate terminal with no facilities bus out to the plane at the far end of the airport tight seating and generally a joyless experience. Since when did air travel become so bland and so unexciting? Our biggest disappointment was the Air Asia terminal/departure lounge at Narita airport. Once you enter after check-in you cannot leave and there are no facilities except a toilet and a small shop. We felt trapped and stuck there in a facility that resembles a hospital waiting room. This in a busy and interesting airport with an array of shops cafes etc but we were stuck in this waiting room with no forewarning and no way to leave. Anyone checking in 3 hours in advance as requested would be well advised to time it to the last minute before going through security as this departure lounge is a horrid experience.

If you are flying out to and from any Malaysia small city you are blocked from booking the business class. The implication is that the passenger need to purchase multiple itineraries and no luggage check through to the final destination. Why is Air Asia doing this? It is very inconvenient for business man like us when we need to rush from one gate to another and what more to say rushing to collect luggage and check in again. Imagine with the new KLIA2.

My wife booked a ticket for me to go to India via KL, but she booked it under my nick name because domestically in the Philippines I travel under that name. The ticket we bought however does allow passenger name change, but there is a fine print which is a total con. The chat service and customer support just kept throwing us back and forth and finally when we pushed they promised that it will be refunded we just have to buy another ticket for the moment. Well this happened December 2016. Till now no answer, just a template answer saying no refund because the name is different. To me, I don't care about the money it's a small issue.

The airport boarding room in Bandung was not too big, some passengers were standing. The flight delayed for 30 minutes. The ground staff didn't arrange the queue according to the seat area, so people started to queque 30 minutes before call. I was not aware about pre meal order and decided not to order on board. The seat space was enough for me, maybe near emergency exit was wider. For low cost flight, I think I would recommend AirAsia.",1,bandung kuala lumpur check fair asked pay baggage fee didnt know ticket fare bought online covering baggage airport boarding room bandung big passengers standing delayed minutes ground staff didnt arrange queue according seat area people started queque minutes call aware pre meal order decided order board seat space enough maybe near emergency exit wider low cost think would recommend airasia

472,"Chiang Mai to Singapore via Bangkok. I have no qualms with Air Asia flight. What I want to point out is whether Air Asia's website can be more user-friendly. For example, there is no ""manage my flight"" in the website, Web-check in was another headache. It was so difficult to do so as the website cannot find my flight despite keying in the booking reference number and correct full name! One has to sign in and view one's bookings in order to access the flight. Having succeeded in going to the web-check in page, I had to key in five passengers passports numbers and other details, But lo and behold when all done, I was told session timed out and everything I keyed in was gone.

473,"  Jakarta to Singapore. Tremendous online website, especially for mobile devices. Booking and paying for a flight has never been more easy. Two days before the flight I received a reminder email including flight and departure/arrival terminal details plus a direct link to the online check in website . Save/print or screenshot the email and thats really all you need. According to the email the departure terminal was number 3, in reality it was terminal 2F. The difference is a 30.000IDR taxi drive that can take up to 30 minutes. This can make the difference between making it in time or being late. Very sloppy from Air Asia as they have greatly invested in a big marketing campaign at terminal 2F itself. Simple mistake, big consequence. Check in was easy, quick and efficient. All the check in desks could be used for all Air Asia flights. Boarding was done by a bus that brought us to an aerobridge which seems an odd thing to do but ok, it works. Boarding was a little late, as was the push back of the aircraft. Jakarta can be a very busy airport but this was not the case for this specific flight. Total delay before take off was about twenty minutes. The aircraft cabin had a pleasant cold temperature and the boarding process was relatively quick, although the aircraft was not full. The aircraft itself felt it needed a big cabin overhaul. Carpet was dirty and the safety card / inflight magazines were sticky and dirty. As we all know, this is a low cost carrier and we all enjoy the low fares. Air Asia's main focus is delivering value for money. But, is it necessary to have a pink, brown and greenish advertisement for a coffee company all over the overhead luggage bins? Service onboard was friendly and all crew spoke good English. I even got a free sandwich and a glass of water as it was included in my added cargo baggage package.  In terms of service it is all you want and need from a low cost carrier and more.

476,"I traveled from Bangalore to Melbourne via Kuala Lumpur in October this year by AirAsia and AirAsia X.  The booking experience was fine. Had already registered on their website for a domestic flight earlier. While planning my trip researched on Internet and found out they had this sale where Tickets were priced less than half of Others. Without a second thought booked two for me and my wife. While booking came to know that Checked in baggage and meals need a Surcharge. But even then two tickets cost me Rs 70000 for return with 1 checked in baggage and 4 Meals which was Super Value. I had to pay for seat selection with my wife while web checkin or if I wanted extra leg space. The flights arrived and departed on schedule, flights were clean, Flight attendants were properly dressed and spoke English.  Food served was average and I discovered I had to pay more in Indian rupees while pre-booking while it cost less in Malaysian currency inflight. Toilets were clean.

477,Praya/Lombok to Kuala Lumpur (KLIA2) as a HiFlyer. I booked the Premium Flex fare to enjoy the extras such as 20kg checked baggage and priority seating. Online booking is straightforward if a bit annoying due to the many forced opt-out options one has to explicitly decline. Web check-in however started to be positively jarring: mobile boarding pass didn't work with a European cell number the airport kiosk can't reprint an already issued boarding pass and the whole experience gets very frustrating very soon. Ground staff were helpful but this is too little to overcome the system's shortcomings. Priority boarding is a myth at LOP as there is only a single security line at the gate which opened extremely late. That way everyone finds themselves standing in a long line with no seating while hundreds of empty seats wait inside the gate area. I ended up boarding among the last just to fight for some overhead bin space and reclaim my assigned seat. FAs didn't really seem very engaged and it took some doing to get their attention just to purchase a drink onboard. The flight was okay but the general feel is of a barebone service.,1,prayalombok kuala lumpur klia hiflyer booked premium flex fare enjoy extras kg checked baggage priority seating online booking straightforward bit annoying due many forced optout options one explicitly decline web checkin however started positively jarring mobile boarding pass didnt work european cell number airport kiosk cant reprint already issued boarding pass whole experience gets frustrating soon ground staff helpful little overcome systems shortcomings priority boarding myth lop single security line gate opened extremely late way everyone finds standing long line seating hundreds empty seats wait inside gate area ended boarding among last fight overhead bin space reclaim assigned seat fas didnt really seem engaged took get attention purchase drink onboard okay general feel barebone servic

I was already web-checked in with pre-paid luggage. The main check-in sign-board directed me to R52 - but when I arrived there it was closed even though I was exactly 2 hours ahead of departure time. Every queue was choked with people. I could not see any sign on the LCD screens for baggage drop-off. Every queue had the sign ""Excess Baggage Payment"" both on the board and at the start of the queue. I approached an usher who asked ""What time is your flight?"". She did not ask me ""Have you web-checked-in?"" and ""Do you have excess baggage?"". After about 1 hour I got to the front of the queue and dropped off my bags. After that I found out that I had been sent to the wrong queue. The was a queue for express luggage posted with a waist-high sign that had been hidden by all the queuing passengers.

484,BLR-KUL-REP. The seats are tight. If you are tall you're going to have a problem. On the short haul flights from KUL-REP it didn't bother me but from BLR-KUL which was little more than 4 hours being cramped was a bit of a problem. Make sure you weigh your bags before check-in. At the last minute I bought something which put my bag over by 5 lbs. I ended up paying close to $75 in excess baggage about the price of the ticket for going from KUL to REP. I learned you could pay before hand online for excess baggage and its more than 50% less than paying at the airport. Overall I didn't mind Air Asia for short haul flights - under 3 hours but will definitely fly a full price airline for anything long haul. I should also add that their set up at LCCT in KUL was a mess and their ground staff wasn't very friendly.,1,blrkulrep seats tight tall youre going problem short haul flights kulrep didnt bother blrkul little hours cramped bit problem make sure weigh bags checkin last minute bought something put bag lbs ended paying close excess baggage price ticket going kul rep learned could pay hand online excess baggage less paying airport overall didnt mind air asia short haul flights hours definitely fly full price airline anything long haul also add set lcct kul mess ground staff wasnt friend

On arrival at CNX they had 3 flights departing at approximately the same time and only 3 check-in desks open. There was no Baggage Drop-Off counter for passengers who took the time to check-in online - even their self-check- in facility was out of order! I queued for 40 minutes. Not providing the facility at CNX whilst promoting its use is unreasonable and irrational. Besides this aspect of their service this flight and the previous five with Air Asia have been similarly delayed. Don't be taken in with the price sometimes it is cheaper to fly TG.

But I would advise anyone proposing to fly with Air Asia where there is a connecting international flight to consider to allow ample time because flight delays and even cancellations are the order of the day on Thai Air Asia.

Ground service is normal, quick check-in and baggage drop although when entering boarding gate (is it normal at CGK, one boarding gate could serve 2 different flights) did not put clear signs indicating which queue lines were for which flight, some passenger queued in the wrong line. Delayed take-off due to runaway congestion and bad visibility (maybe) but we still landed ahead of schedule. Food, I ordered Chicken Kungpao with rice and it was just bad.

556,"  I booked the inauguration flight from Kota Kinabalu to Wuhan on 22 March 2016. Upon boarding, I found out that all crew were non Chinese speaking despite the large number of passengers from China. A big disappointment was that the crew made the safety announcement in Malay. Based on my observation, the crew had communication problems in assisting and handling the requests from passengers from the moment of boarding to arriving at our destination. I have flown a number of airlines in the region and in fact Chinese speaking crew are the norm for routes with high Chinese traffic. Return flight from Wuhan (WUH) to Kota Kinabalu (BKI). Wuhan International Airport is a rather small terminal with two rows of multiple check-in counters adjacent to each other. The check-in process started at 22.00 and was prompt. Boarding was smooth despite a number of flights departed at this time. Boarding was rather efficient without cabin crew greeting passengers as soon as they stepped onboard. Communication breakdown is unavoidable as all cabin crew allocated for this flight were non Chinese speaking crew. Soon after airborne, the cabin crew brought the meal cart out, no pre booked meals were served. About two hours later, I was woken by an announcement from the crew to inform any passenger who found a lost phone to return it to them. Having found no response, the cabin crew had no choice but to permit the passenger who lost her phone to make an announcement. This was not the first time I have experienced this situation. In my previous flight, one of the cabin crew had no choice but to turn to me to assist her to communicate with the passengers.

On our return flight we ran into a few problems, upon arriving at the airport in Bangkok the flight was being showed as delayed and when we were checking in the staff informed that the flight was delayed due to a late departure from it origin airport. We sat in the terminal waiting for updates, one hour after we were supposed to depart we were allowed to board the plane and sat down in our allocated seats. The captain announced that the flight was going to be further delayed due to a faulty tire on the plane and it would take around 45-60 minutes to replace the tire. The captain kept us updated throughout the process, after roughly and hour we set off from Bangkok and were quickly in the skies. Thirty minutes into the flight I couldn't help but notice that the engine was making a very loud noise, it was a lot louder than usual. We circled the airport for around about thirty minutes when the captain announced we needed to re land at the airport due to engine problems. We landed back in Bangkok and were escorted to a terminal where we were told to await further instructions, we were given food vouchers while we had to wait and given the means to make calls.

567,"I have flown many flights with Air Asia and Air AsiaX over the past few years. I generally found them to be a value airline but my opinion is changing. I flew from HoChiMinhCity to Kuala Lumpur return. As with most discount airlines the ""all in price"" listed in the booking is hard to find. First of all you have to wade through the various ad-ons for baggage insurance etc deducting them as you go or you end up with an inflated fare. But to my surprise as I hadn't experienced this gouge before the booking imposed a $12 fee for using my credit card. As well the onboard duty free sales do not take credit cards only Malaysian currency and US dollars despite stating that all major currencies were accepted. My seat-mate on the inbound flight had to convince staff to accept Euros. All in all after all costs were added up the flight was only marginally cheaper than Vietnam Airlines and far less hassle with a full service carrier. Air Asia advertises low-cost but their fares have risen dramatically in the past few years. I don't think the average customer wants to have to spend time and energy having to find the ""all in price"" deducting the various ad-ons only to be stung at the end with the credit card charge. By then you are so fed up with the search for the initial fare that you just agree to pay the ""fine"" for using your credit card. In my caes it amounted to a surcharge of about 15%. The credit card companies charge their customers 3%. Flying discount airlines can be the only reasonable cost way to fly to some destinations.

If you have to change your flight you will get clobbered. Check-in was another problem. Their website says that international check-in opens 3 hours before the flight - not true. The check-in did not open until 2 hours before. Once it did the queue did move at a painfully slow pace. The agent seem to have problems with every person checking in and had to call the supervisor over more than once for every passenger.

594,Melbourne to Singapore with a stopover in KUL. Plane was clean with comfortable lighting. The seat's pitch is not a problem but the issue lies with the amount of shoulder space between passengers. There is just not enough space if you have broad shoulders. The seats are comfortable for smaller builds only. I had to lean on one side throughout my 8 hour flight. The poor quality padding starts to present itself about 2 hours into flight. The toilets are very clean. The sandwich taste good on both legs. The attendants are friendly but firm. I can see why it is the best low cost airline because it does offer the best value. I personally would prefer more space on long haul flights. Again what you pay is what you get.,1,melbourne singapore stopover kul plane clean comfortable lighting seats pitch problem issue lies amount shoulder space passengers enough space broad shoulders seats comfortable smaller builds lean one side throughout hour poor quality padding starts present hours toilets clean sandwich taste good legs attendants friendly firm see best low cost airline offer best value personally would prefer space long haul flights pay get
595,Having found a promotion fare from CNX-MFM I thought I would try the latest destination out of Chiang Mai. I was interested to see why they gave up Singapore in favour of Macau. It quickly became apparent as most of the pax were in a tour group from mainland china. Standard Air Asia service although this time I booked a hotseat and had a nice chicken lasagne. Flight was 30 mins early. No jetway at MFM but the walk in fact makes getting to immigration easier. Next to the airport is a new jetfoil service to Hong Kong.,1,found promotion fare cnxmfm thought would try latest destination chiang mai interested see gave singapore favour macau quickly became apparent pax tour group mainland china standard air asia service although time booked hotseat nice chicken lasagne mins early jetway mfm walk fact makes getting immigration easier next airport new jetfoil service hong kong

601,KUL-HKT-KUL. Outbound flight was delayed by more than an hour due to late arrival of the plane as well as technical issues. Return flight was more pleasant and arrived about 15 mins early. It would seem that AirAsia is now deliberately splitting up passengers and seating them separately in order to encourage them to pay extra for advance seat selection. I witnessed a passenger frantically trying to re-arrange seating onboard so that his companion could be seated with him. My own companion was also seated across the aisle but we were not too bothered by that. We got excellent value for money because we booked these tickets about a year ahead at one of the sale promotions (Fare was US$ 45 return).,1,kulhktkul outbound delayed hour due late arrival plane well technical issues return pleasant arrived mins early would seem airasia deliberately splitting passengers seating separately order encourage pay extra advance seat selection witnessed passenger frantically trying rearrange seating onboard companion could seated companion also seated across aisle bothered got excellent value money booked tickets year ahead one sale promotions fare us return

616,"  Singapore to Kuala Lumpur. Even after adding in seat selection and 20kg of baggage, the price was still affordable and cheap considering that I only booked a month before the flight. There were problems with the self check-in as I had checked in online with AirAsia, luckily this was sorted out very quickly. Immigration at Changi Airport was very fast. The plane left on the dot at 7:35am and the gate my plane was at was the closest to the runway, so we were in the air very quickly. The seat pitch was just about okay for my height, and it was comfortable for a short flight. The plane was one of the older ones in AirAsia's fleet, not fitted with the sharklets seen on the newer A320s, and the cabin did show signs of ageingty. As it was a 40min flight and a budget airline, there was not much the cabin crew had to do but they were warm and friendly. One interesting perk about this flight was the ability to stream the inflight entertainment into my own device without needing to download a seperate app; all I had to do was to connect to the inflight WiFi which was enabled even on this short hop and I found it very unique, setting aside AirAsia from other budget carriers, and the selection was quite generous too, with some movies, documentaries and even games. The flight landed in Kuala Lumpur early and we had a short taxi into KLIA2, very quickly we were disembarking. Overall, given AirAsia's punctuality and cost, I would definitely pick AirAsia again if I'm travelling to Malaysia or want to travel on a budget.",1,singapore kuala lumpur even adding seat selection kg baggage price still affordable cheap considering booked month problems self checkin checked online airasia luckily sorted quickly immigration changi airport fast plane left dot gate plane closest runway air quickly seat pitch okay height comfortable short plane one older ones airasias fleet fitted sharklets seen newer cabin show signs ageingty min budget airline much cabin crew warm friendly one interesting perk ability stream inflight entertainment device without needing download seperate app connect inflight wifi enabled even short hop found unique setting aside airasia budget carriers selection quite generous movies documentaries even games landed kuala lumpur early short taxi klia quickly disembarking overall given airasias punctuality cost would definitely pick airasia im travelling malaysia want travel budget

Although I was flying on cheap tickets I could buy exit row aisle seats for both flights. The middle seat remained vacant in both flights probably because no one wants to pay for the pleasure of sitting in the middle seat! In both flights the meal that I had preordered turned out to be pretty tasty. This is what I like about this airline - at the time of booking you can buy the degree of comfort that you want, verify it and then pay for it. Many other airlines would not allow cheap ticket holders to select premium seats. After flying full service airlines on business for decades I have recently switched to AirAsia in part due to the simplicity of the whole process - booking, seat and meal selection, checkin and boarding. The entire meal service is over quickly and they leave you in peace for the rest of the flight. If you need any snack or drink you could walk to the galley and buy it.

623,"  Short flight from Singapore to Kuching, midday flight on a Sunday. Flight was more than 50% empty, so obviously the overall experience was better. Boarding was on time and efficient, and crew were reasonably pleasant. For this short flight, I had paid for the first row of seats, and so legroom was aplenty. The A320 had obviously seen quite a lot of service, seats were clean but felt like the cushions had sagged a little. Halfway through the flight, was impressed that inflight connectivity (rokki) allowed reading of the AirAsia inflight magazine, brief travel guides, news and simple games on iPad, all for free. Impressive for a no-frills airline. Flight landed on time, and disembarkation was fuss free. If seat comfort was a tad better, this would be a 5-star low-cost airline flight.",1,short singapore kuching midday sunday empty obviously overall experience better boarding time efficient crew reasonably pleasant short paid first row seats legroom aplenty obviously seen quite lot service seats clean felt like cushions sagged little halfway impressed inflight connectivity rokki allowed reading airasia inflight magazine brief travel guides news simple games ipad free impressive nofrills airline landed time disembarkation fuss free seat comfort tad better would star lowcost airlin

I was apprehensive of the questionable standard since it's a budget airline which gives the bare minimum, but get you from A to B. I took the plunge and tried to return to Hong Kong from Bali with it. It was operated by Thai Air Asia. I booked fly+bag+eat combo, sat on front row seat. Check in at Bali airport was friendly and efficient. I am happy to report that the experience had been very positive. Crew were courteous and smiling. Ordered meals were promptly delivered, and it actually tasted ok. I like the fact that Air Asia makes no qualm about bringing outside food and drink on board for own consumption. Seat was bound in leather, well padded and comfortable for the 4 hour journey. There was a lay over of 2 hours in Bangkok old airport Don Muang, it was welcoming as one could stretch the legs and do some shopping, or eat a good meal before the 2nd leg. The same good standard of service continued for the next flight back home. I was able to check my bags through from bali to Hong Kong. Transit process was very simple and direction crystal clear.

628,"  Kuala Lumpur to Langkawi. When I was planning the trip to Langkawi, AirAsia offered the cheapest tickets. So the price was the main factor while choosing AirAsia and I must say it was really good value for money. I checked in online and everything was really easy. At the airport we had to wait about 15 minutes in the queue for the bag drop, but that was totally normal. Boarding process was well-organised. The staff on-board was very kind and helpful. The legroom was quite short for me, but as the flight took only one hour, it was easily bearable.

637," Yogyakarta to Denpasar with AirAsia. I used Web check in and boarding pass printing at home and no baggage (although for domestic always include 15 kg baggage). Direct to departures after security check. Good boarding process. Nice livery. I pre order 2 pax food (nasi lemak and chicken dijon) and get free 2 drink (hot coffee and still water). Total price only IDR 67 k (USD 5) for delicious food and drinks. I eat one portion in the flight and one in waiting next flight.

Extra luggage, express boarding, dedicated counter for check-in, an inflight meal, etc. For such short flights, which have become so commoditized, I like having choices that are clearly outlined and well priced.

648,"I've flown Air Asia a lot, so I think it's time I finally gave them a review. I've taken many of the budget airlines in Southeast Asia, but Air Asia remains my favorite. In fact, I think Air Asia may even be better than some of the full carriers in the area. I've flown Siem Reap to Kuala Lumpur, Kuala Lumpur to Singapore, Singapore to Bangkok, Bangkok to Chiang Mai, Chiang Mai to Singapore, Jakarta to Yogyakarta, and the Singapore/Jakarta route several times. I never had any problems with any of my flights. None of my flights were ever delayed, which definitely can't be said for the other airlines I've taken around Southeast Asia. Their app also works well, but it's only available for use at certain airports. The ground staff is can sometimes seem a bit course, but they are efficient and get the job done. Don't expect a luxurious ride, this is a budget airline after all, and you get what you pay for. The air staff is very nice and courteous. I've purchased food from them, which I found to be tasty and reasonability priced considering it is a budget airline and you're in the sky. They also sell a variety of things on board, but I've never purchased one of them. There isn't much for entertainment besides the travel magazine, but I've only ever taken short flights with them, so it's easy to entertain yourself with a book or your own device. There is not a lot of leg space though, which is to be expected, but if you are a larger person, you might want to consider purchasing one of the priority seats instead.

We used to fly Jetstar because as a Qantas Club member we could use the QF lounge in Perth - that doesn't open just for Jetstar flights, so you have to jag it when there's a Qantas international flight going out - not that there's many of those these days. So this time we decided to give Air Asia a go because their fares were excellent. Spot on time departure ex Perth, clean aircraft and we paid extra for Row 1. Pleasant enough flight for a LCC. We paid extra for the Red Carpet service on the return journey, and this was an absolute treat. No queues, someone to escort you through immigration, and access to the Premier Lounge which is on a par with the QF Business lounges in Perth. Also you get to board first, so minimal queuing - for frequent travellers to Bali this is worth paying for. The usual customer types on board making it mildly embarrassing for the FA's but they'd be used to it on that run.

Ground crew in KL kept customers waiting for more than 20 mins as they served 1 customer with issues. Common sense would dictate that this customer be served separately and kept the line moving.

Not very comfortable for a long flight but for a short flight you can put up with it. The price was pretty reasonable. They do charge for everything though.

Checking their website this particular 0850 KUL departure for Perth no longer appears. So they have just cancelled the flight because the were not enough passengers. As a result instead of a 2 hour connection in KUL I now have an 18 hour connection at KUL. No compensation offered or even interest in the gross inconvenience to passengers who have booked and paid on the basis of a reasonable connection.

676,DMK-PHN-DMK - Not much to write about frankly as this is a low-fair airline. Having their base in DMK airport is a strategic move away from the chaotic Suvarnbhumi. Make sure you booked earlier as the ticket will be almost as expensive as the regular cost airline given booking only a couple weeks ahead. Check-in both DMK and PHN is no problem.

678,Three short flights on Air Asia DMK-RGN RGN-DMK DMK-SGN. All flights via newish A320s. A little chaotic at check in for DMK flights but otherwise the boarding process was easy.

679,July 16th Bangkok Don Muang to Phuket. Last year we arrived 20 minutes before departure at Don Muang airport in Bangkok (very difficult to reach during rush hour).

Arriving in Phuket our luggage was also in good condition and well kept by the aircraft personnel. I think that Air Asia is worth the money.,1,july th bangkok muang phuket last year arrived minutes departure muang airport bangkok difficult reach rush hour several queues asked air asia ground personnel could help helped us one minute departure entered plain arriving phuket luggage also good condition well kept aircraft personnel think air asia worth money

682,I did six flights with AirAsia Indonesia and AirAsiaX from Sydney KL Makassar Denpasar Makassar KL Sydney. I found the airline to be exactly up to my expectations. It's a budget no frills low airfare airline. I'm not too tall 1.8m and not too fat 73 kgs so it was fine for me. The food was good and if I didn't want any extras I didn't have to pay for them.

I thought check in was efficient but it turns out I should have been given lounge access but this didn't happen so I bought breakfast. I guess the priority boarding was good but I'd had to pay extra for my seat allocation as well. The flight was good with friendly and helpful crew and regular updates from the flight deck.

690,My first domestic trip CNX-DMK return. Was pleased to see what they had done with DMK. Disappointed that we were bussed to terminal but as it dropped us off nearer baggage area without walking far we shouldn't grumble. Efficient boarding at both ends meant early arrival on both sectors. Had the pancake combo for breakfast. Surprised that the drink offered was water and not coffee. I only used them as a friend arrived at DMK also with Air Asia. Price was almost same as Bangkok Airways to BKK and will continue to use them if flying to BKK and beyond.

Both ground and air crews were excellent extremely helpful and kind with our elderly parents with mobility issues. Check in at all airports was quick and efficient. Arrival at KL LCCT was a shock did not expect to have to walk the long distance from the tarmac to the terminal building in the hot blazing sun. Most airports would have a bus to transport the passengers to the terminal building. Not a good first impression of KL.

693,Bangkok to Yangon Yangon to KUL and KUL to Bangalore. Flights left slightly late. Food available on board was reasonably priced and good quality. However I was intrigued that each time we weighed in our bags on the Air Asia scales they were 1kg to 1.5 kg heavier than on Qantas or Thai scales - and we had exactly the same contents in them. I also noticed that the crew paid scant attention to young children who did not have seat belts on.,1,bangkok yangon yangon kul kul bangalore flights left slightly late food available board reasonably priced good quality however intrigued time weighed bags air asia scales kg kg heavier qantas thai scales exactly contents also noticed crew paid scant attention young children seat belt

On a return flight from Kuching to KUL the incoming flight to Kuching was almost 3.5 hours late. No explanation was offered. As a consequence I failed to catch a connecting flight from KL to Penang. The counter staff at LCCT were helpful and reissued my ticket. The only problem was that this was the last flight to Penang that evening. It was a very long day! Providing you leave 3 to 4 hours leeway if you have another flight booked generally AA are pretty good.

Not their latest aircraft but interior in good condition. I was lucky to be off the aircraft quickly as the skies opened and there was a short sharp downpour and anyone from the rear of the plane would have been a drowned rat as there is no jetway from AirAsia flights.,1,arrived airport minutes scheduled departure time find checkin stops minutes automatic check machine programmed check deemed late checked desk without problem without checked bags plane late inbound made time south standard airasia service reasonable cabin crew latest aircraft interior good condition lucky aircraft quickly skies opened short sharp downpour anyone rear plane would drowned rat jetway airasia flight

We went in fearing worst after reading reviews about the airline and also about the LCCT in KL. However we came back fully satisfied with AirAsia's service and the amenities offered at LCCT. You really cannot expect more for the fares on offer and it wasn't as if there was a dearth of choices. Both airline and terminals were perfectly serviceable.

Every flight was great staff were friendly and basically you pay for what you get. If you fly a budget airline and pay minimal cost for your tickets expect this and no more. For me this is my preference. My only criticism is around the minimal options for food and after pre-booking inflight entertainment and paying for it - it not being available. I believe improvements can be made in this area. Otherwise the seats facilities service is great - expect to get what you pay for and you'll be more than happy.,1,flew flights total air asia x air asia gold coast kuala lumpur kuala lumpur vietnam vietnam kuala lumpur kuala lumpur hong kong hong kong penang penang langkawi langkawi penang penang kuala lumpur kuala lumpur gold coast every great staff friendly basically pay get fly budget airline pay minimal cost tickets expect preference criticism around minimal options food prebooking inflight entertainment paying available believe improvements made area otherwise seats facilities service great expect get pay youll happi

Reasonable cabin crew. I ordered meals in advance and they were onboard although I was listed as a 'no-show' on the manifest. Return to CNX the breakfast pancakes were cold and trying to get the packet of maple syrup open was like a challenge from a game show.

Having flown Air Asia for many years I notice the staff are not as enthusiastic as in the early days nor do they have time to interact with passengers. I wish the company would enforce their 'one carry-on bag' policy. Some passengers on one flight had up to four large bags. What's the point in having the policy if it's not enforced.,1,three flights kolkata cal bbk bbkcnx return flights comfortable one exception time air asias offer basic good seats reasonably comfortable better many budget airlines flown air asia many years notice staff enthusiastic early days time interact passengers wish company would enforce one carryon bag policy passengers one four large bags whats point policy enforc

714,TAA has re-timed their CNX-SIN flight and this is much better although it is a late arrival in CNX on the return sector. My flight to SIN was slightly early but the return was almost 30 mins early into CNX arriving at 2235 instead of 2300. Boarding in SIN aided this and the aircraft with 55 pax pushed back 10 mins ahead of schedule but we lost that time waiting for a slot at the end of the runway! As per usual I ate at Changi and filled my water bottle from a fountain at the gate. 30 baht for their tiny bottle of water is a rip off. Looks like TAA is eating into Silkair's customer base as the latter has dropped its prices to about 1000 baht more than TAA but them there are no add ons and you get a free meal and beer. All in all I'm starting to warm to their Changi service after an indifferent start in January.,1,taa retimed cnxsin much better although late arrival cnx return sector slightly early return almost mins early cnx arriving instead boarding aided aircraft pax pushed back mins ahead schedule lost time waiting slot end runway per usual ate changi filled water bottle fountain gate baht tiny bottle water rip looks like taa eating silkairs customer base latter dropped prices baht taa add ons get free meal beer im starting warm changi service indifferent start januari

I only had a handbag and I was directed to a counter for that purpose. Service was good. I am 1.81 and found the seat spacing adequate. There was a wide variety of food options which could be ordered when the ticket was purchased. Cabin staff professional and friendly on both flights. My only complaint is that on the return flight a PRM (Person with Reduced Mobility) was seated between me and the aisle (I had a window seat). I don't think this is legal and it caused discomfort for the other person.,1,bangkok yangon bangkok bought ticket internet process bit time consuming click many pages hours web check convenient could check flights still go checkin counter airport document check check bangkok long handbag directed counter purpose service good found seat spacing adequate wide variety food options could ordered ticket purchased cabin staff professional friendly flights complaint return prm person reduced mobility seated aisle window seat dont think legal caused discomfort person
717,"  It's so nice to welcome back AirAsia after almost a 2 years absence since the start of the pandemic. After having had a few bad experience with Malaysia airlines quite recently. I chose Air Asia for the value of money. On Christmas day, flight was on time. Check in at the airport was orderly, premium flex customers perks and priority were observed. Boarding by the zone was very orderly also. Plane is clean and crew were lovely and welcoming. It really pays to get the exit row for the extra leg room and comfort. My pre-ordered meal of Bukhara chicken rice was delicious ad spicy, and it came with a small bottle of water. I was impressed at how efficient the crew worked, and they kept the 2 toilets clean at regular intervals as well. Landing was so smooth too. Luggage delivered in a timely manner and in good condition. For someone who is used to flying premium airlines in business class, I must say this was a very inoressive experience. I think in future for medium to short haul flights, I really don't mind to fly with them and save some money as well.

The only setback was a group of passengers loudly throughout the whole flight, and stewards/stewardess unable to get them to stop.

Cabin service was good. I have found AA and AAX cabin staff to be at least as good as those of full-service airlines but some of the ground staff at the old LCCT and on the Gold Coast have been abrupt if now downright rude.

752,My wife and I flew from Sydney to Kuala Lumpar and then on to Phuket with Air Asia in business class albeit the KL to Phuket sector did not have any business class - which we had been warned about prior to the trip so this was no surprise. We were very pleasantly surprised at the amount of space and the ability to turn the seat into an almost flat bed albeit the incline was just enough to make sliding down the seat a bit of a problem. The service was excellent and whilst the food was quite basic and they had not got our pre ordered meals correct the food was adequate. The inflight entertainment was also quite basic but as we had been warned of this we had our own tablets etc so we certainly did not suffer.

754,AK759 Penang to Singapore 3 Sep. Check-in for this flight was very good barely queued for 3 or so minutes before the airline's agents checked us in. Boarding for this flight was not as organised as I would have preferred. Firstly the airport mixed up the gates so there were a lot of confused passengers rushing to the correct gate. Secondly the gate agents did not issue PA announcements so many passengers quickly rushed to the front of the gate counter in the hope that they'll get to board first which shouldn't be the case for an airline that charges for priority boarding. Boarding was slightly delayed due to preparation of aircraft but the airline made up for the delay by boarding passengers through the front and rear exits. The flight departed Penang just a few minutes late once airborne the crew came around quickly to distribute immigration cards and take orders for drinks/deliver pre-booked meals. Aircraft was a bit worn and tired - my seat pocket was ripped on the left side and passenger in front of me seemed to have trouble reclining. Nevertheless seat was quite comfortable. Arrival in Singapore 10 minutes ahead of schedule and disembarked within 10 minutes of landing. AirAsia is ok for the price will consider using them again for flights to and from Malaysia.,1,penang singapore sep checkin good barely queued minutes airlines agents checked us boarding organised would preferred firstly airport mixed gates lot confused passengers rushing correct gate secondly gate agents issue pa announcements many passengers quickly rushed front gate counter hope theyll get board first shouldnt case airline charges priority boarding boarding slightly delayed due preparation aircraft airline made delay boarding passengers front rear exits departed penang minutes late airborne crew came around quickly distribute immigration cards take orders drinksdeliver prebooked meals aircraft bit worn tired seat pocket ripped left side passenger front seemed trouble reclining nevertheless seat quite comfortable arrival singapore minutes ahead schedule disembarked within minutes landing airasia ok price consider using flights malaysia

766,Flew 4 times back in May 2013 as they are no doubt the major low-cost airline in Asia. One is DMK-PHN and another one is DMK-HKT. Both are returned flight. Good move by Thai AirAsia for choosing DMK as their hub - less hassle and easy to get to. Check-in was easy and it is how you talk with the check-in staff in order to get seat you want/close to your partner/friend. I flew with my fiancé so we did manage to get the seat we want by just talking your way through. Aircraft is a new A319 which was a complete step-up from their old B737 a couple years ago I flew with them.

Cabin staff also enforced the seats with people trying to move in to the empty row in front of us and all were removed. Only issue was passport control in Singapore all desks open but overwhelmed with the amount of people to deal with. Only downside is with all the space and empty jetways and stands why oh why bus people to the plane? With the hot seats you get to board first but boarding the bus first does not help as its still scramble on the plane. 2nd leg to Phuket again easy check in had 'normal' seats on plane and leg room is ok but I am not the tallest guy.

781,Another round trip from CNX to KUL. Once you know how to 'play' low cost airlines they do offer good value for money (but not always). The LCCT is getting a bit long in the tooth for the number of pax passing through but BKK immigration staff would do well to see how to handle pax properly and efficiently. I prepaid for a meal and found it to be very tasty indeed. Although they claim to have a no outside food policy onboard they don't implement this. Biggest problem with low cost carriers is the pax they carry.

791,Shopping around I found that there was an excellent promotion fare with TAA from SIN to CNX. I used this service on day one in January and hoped that they could at least get it back to CNX on time. The flight has been retimed since earlier in the year and it seems to work as the flight got into CNX 30 minutes early (as opposed to 30 mins late in January). I ate at Changi airport avoiding having to buy their overpriced meals onboard. As is usual with Air Asia the flights are pretty routine and uneventful. The check in kiosks make life very easy when having no baggage and I was able to check-in well ahead of regulation time. Thai crew were polite and efficient and I noticed that the first officer was a woman (a first for TAA?). Don't see many of them in Asia!! I'm slowly coming round to the fact that if needs must then Air Asia is a viable option provided you shop around and don't just assume that they are the cheapest because they say they are. Disappointed to see that the fuel surcharge is back for my June trip to Singapore! The other problem I have with them is that in allowing 'everyone to now fly' they allow people to do so who frankly shouldn't be allowed out of their living rooms and have no idea of how to behave when travelling or worst of all why the crew handed out immigration cards before landing.,1,shopping around found excellent promotion fare taa cnx used service day one january hoped could least get back cnx time retimed since earlier year seems work got cnx minutes early opposed mins late january ate changi airport avoiding buy overpriced meals onboard usual air asia flights pretty routine uneventful check kiosks make life easy baggage able checkin well ahead regulation time thai crew polite efficient noticed first officer woman first taa dont see many asia im slowly coming round fact needs must air asia viable option provided shop around dont assume cheapest say disappointed see fuel surcharge back june trip singapore problem allowing everyone fly allow people frankly shouldnt allowed living rooms idea behave travelling worst crew handed immigration cards land

793,CGK-HKT. The flights were on time aircraft very clean and well-maintained and service was very friendly and professional. I paid a small supplement for one of the 'hotseats' and it was well worth it. The return ticket cost around USD100 (promo fare) including add-ons and extras. Excellent value for money. The problem with Air Asia seems to be actually managing to get these promo fares. They are advertised heavily on the website but when you try to make a booking very often only the regular fares come up. I think you need to book far in advance as I did with this ticket. Their regular fares are often only a bit cheaper than other carriers.,1,cgkhkt flights time aircraft clean wellmaintained service friendly professional paid small supplement one hotseats well worth return ticket cost around usd promo fare including addons extras excellent value money problem air asia seems actually managing get promo fares advertised heavily website try make booking often regular fares come think need book far advance ticket regular fares often bit cheaper carri
794,BKK-CAN and HKG-BKK. My first experience of Thailand's division of Air Asia. Good value for money and only a few observations. Having paid for a 'hot seat' the priority boarding in BKK was only to the bus not the plane. There were just two of us so everyone else piled on which meant we were actually one of the last on to the aircraft. The other is the price of the soft drinks which are frankly a rip-off. Flights on-time and one of the aircraft was virtually brand new. If the price is right this is the way to go but they are not always the cheapest option especially to Hong Kong where competition is fierce with a multitude of third country carriers flying that route.,1,bkkcan hkgbkk first experience thailands division air asia good value money observations paid hot seat priority boarding bkk bus plane two us everyone else piled meant actually one last aircraft price soft drinks frankly ripoff flights ontime one aircraft virtually brand new price right way go always cheapest option especially hong kong competition fierce multitude third country carriers flying rout

All previous flights where on AirAsia and only pretty short so I was a bit scepticle using them for this 4h+ flight. The direct options between Bali and Bangkok are limited to either Thai or AirAsia from what I can see, the AirAsia schedule suited me better so I choose the full package including luggage, Red Carpet Service, preferred seat, food and comfort kit. Check in was quick using the red carpet service which was also fully escorted from check in through security to the lounge. The lounge is old but so is the airport but fine to spend an hour with food and wifi. Boarding through gate 6a was done with priority and included a bus ride on my own as part of the red carpet service. Once onboard seat 1A was fine with enough space, not the most comfortable seat but okay. Crew where young but polite the food was also okay for airline food.

829,"June 2015 I went on a small trip around Asia and I had 5 flights with AirAsia: HK-KL, KL-Jakarta, Jakarta-Singapore, Singapore-Bangkok, Bangkok-Xi'an. Beforehand, I read some reviews about AirAsia online and 99% of them were really bad. Everyone was complaining about delayed/changed flights and poor customer service. After all I read, I expected awful flights but in fact everything went smoothly. All flights were on time (except one - 2 hours delay) and customer service was good. And yes, you have to pay for drinks and food on board but come on, I got 5 flights around Asia for less than £200 altogether. I would fly with AirAsia again!",1,june went small trip around asia flights airasia hkkl kljakarta jakartasingapore singaporebangkok bangkokxian beforehand read reviews airasia online really bad everyone complaining delayedchanged flights poor customer service read expected awful flights fact everything went smoothly flights time except one hours delay customer service good yes pay drinks food board come got flights around asia less altogether would fly airasia
830,AirAsia Philippines: MNL-KBO-MNL. This budget airline surprised me in almost every aspect I can think of. Ground and Cabin Crew were friendly both outbound and inbound flight were on time price was reasonable. Although its unfortunate that they are still stationed at the old manila domestic airport I can say that it doesn't mean the other local airlines using the new airport terminal are better. I can even say that my experience with Air Asia was way more pleasant compared to the others.,1,airasia philippines mnlkbomnl budget airline surprised almost every aspect think ground cabin crew friendly outbound inbound time price reasonable although unfortunate still stationed old manila domestic airport say doesnt mean local airlines using new airport terminal better even say experience air asia way pleasant compared oth
831,In January we travelled on four flights in Cambodia-Thailand-Vietnam. Everything about the flights was completely satisfactory and simply no fault could be found.

832,Recently flew from Sydney to KL on Air Asia the flight was pleasant and the staff were friendly. This airline is great value for money and perfect for getting you from point A to B for a fraction of the cost. Inflight entertainment and food is optional yet not necessary. I would recommend upgrading to the quiet zone for a few extra dollars. A number of us also travelled with bikes and other excess luggage the airline was great in taking care of this and we travelled without an issue. I would defiantly recommend and will be returning to Malaysia with them in the future.,1,recently flew sydney air asia pleasant staff friendly airline great value money perfect getting point b fraction cost inflight entertainment food optional yet necessary would recommend upgrading quiet zone extra dollars number us also travelled bikes excess luggage airline great taking care travelled without issue would defiantly recommend returning malaysia futur

The price is the Company's UPS which is helping them do well in Malaysia Indonesia and other Asian countries where they fly. The only thing which I did not like was issuing Paper Boarding passes instead of the regular passes. But I heard they have changed this and are now issuing the normal passes.

837,We flew from KLIA2 to Bangkok Don Muang return at the end of October. I bought the tickets during a promo sale so paid very little. All went well. Flights were on time. It was a holiday weekend on the way out so the flight was full. Coming back things were less hectic as it was a normal weekday. I chose a lunch time flight so we could use a taxi to the airport easily. Check in was quick and the flight went on time. The pre-booked meals were all as expected. Seats were free up the back and we were allowed to use them and spread out. Arrival at KLIA2 was easy as we'd used the airport before. Air Asia offers a great product.

839,Business class was wonderful except for the meals and any drinks had to be brought including water. The inflight entertainment was limited and if you didn't book it with your flight you could not request it once you got to the plane as they only allow enough for the pre booked entertainment. The seating and value for money was wonderful and the 8 hour flight went very quickly. I would recommend that you eat well before going on the flight and you will be very happy with everything else.,1,business class wonderful except meals drinks brought including water inflight entertainment limited didnt book could request got plane allow enough pre booked entertainment seating value money wonderful hour went quickly would recommend eat well going happy everything els
840,20th Apr 2014 Perth-Kuala Lumpur flight D7233. 18th Oct 2014 Kuala Lumpur-Perth flight D232 in Business Class. Cabin consists of 12 seats only so is nice and quiet. Seats are cocoon style. backs do not recline but the seat does all the work thus you never have anyone in front reclining their seat in your face. Nice big pillows and doonas complete the feeling of luxury. Meals are not a highlight however. We find comfort far more important than meals. One good thing about the meal service however is you can tell the cabin crew when you would like to eat. If you want a comfortable few hours sleep where you can stretch full length and cuddle up in a doona can thoroughly recommend Air Asia Business Class.

841,D7206 24 October 2014. This was our first Business Class flight experience with Air Asia and it exceeded all our expectations. Because it is a No Frills Airline we were not expecting a full service. We made our meal selection at the time of booking. We were given a glass of orange juice on arrival and the meals we had selected were delivered soon after take-off. These are normal economy fare but at the fare we paid we did not expect any different. Alcohol was available for payment. The seats however are as good as you would hope to find in any full service business class. Fully lie flat and with the full size pillow and duvet supplied we enjoyed a good sleep for almost the entire flight. Would I chose this again? Absolutely!,1,october first business class experience air asia exceeded expectations frills airline expecting full service made meal selection time booking given glass orange juice arrival meals selected delivered soon takeoff normal economy fare fare paid expect different alcohol available payment seats however good would hope find full service business class fully lie flat full size pillow duvet supplied enjoyed good sleep almost entire would chose absolut
842,We flew PEN-DMK by FD402. The flight departed and arrived on time. Boarding in Penang smooth and efficient as was the arrival in Bangkok. The cabins are fresh and clean. Crew is efficient and accommodating. So when the fares are reasonable I see no reason not to give AirAsia top marks. It helps that DMK although it looks a bit outdated is more efficient than BKK by far. On a sidenote the question on inflight entertainment is not relevant on a 2 hours flight but the inflight magazine is good so high score here.,1,flew pendmk fd departed arrived time boarding penang smooth efficient arrival bangkok cabins fresh clean crew efficient accommodating fares reasonable see reason give airasia top marks helps dmk although looks bit outdated efficient bkk far sidenote question inflight entertainment relevant hours inflight magazine good high scor
843,Having flown many times with AirAsia we are really amused by some of the critical comments about this airline. Having flown dozens of times in SE Asia and might we add that we always fly Business Class for our long haul with another airline we find Air Asia short flights excellent. If you choose to fly long haul on a budget airline don't expect first class service. Air Asia does what it says on the tin. They are punctual good value food wed upgrade our luggage and seat when you book and crew are always pleasant. Petty comments about no entertainment on a 1 or 2 hour flight takes some beating. As with Ryanair follow their rules and you will have no problems.,1,flown many times airasia really amused critical comments airline flown dozens times se asia might add always fly business class long haul another airline find air asia short flights excellent choose fly long haul budget airline dont expect first class service air asia says tin punctual good value food wed upgrade luggage seat book crew always pleasant petty comments entertainment hour takes beating ryanair follow rules problem
844,Having returned from a 3 week trip around SE Asia flying 6 legs with Air Asia I have to recommend their service aircraft ground staff cabin crew and pricing. We had the pleasure of flying Air Asia out of KL and Thai Air Asia out of Bangkok HCMC and Phisanulok. On all occasions check in was quick and efficient with clear direction given boarding spoken in English seat allocation and comfort fine with ample space for the short haul flights FA's were well presented with good command of English flights all left on time food and beverage acceptable with good pricing compared to other budget airlines no IFE but most people talked to their partner the old fashion way of communication which made the flight seem short.

848,I'm not sure what people are expecting when flying with a low cost airline. My trip Bali - Singapore was great maybe having average expectations when booking helped. I made a point of reading the fine print on the Air Asia website which saved me money by pre-booking my luggage and my seat first row of the plane. I was also happy to have paid for the meet and greet option as there were long check-in queues at 05.00 with 3 Air Asia flights departing early. No queue for me right to the front and then assisted with passport control and led to the business lounge (the lounge was pretty poor not Air Asia's fault). Crew were young polite and efficient.

862,Flew one-way KUL-LGW and managed to get standby upgrade from economy to Premium via the Optiontown service. Though notification of successful upgrade only came through via email some 8 hours before the flight. Not best but for the low price it was worth it. 14 hrs flight to LGW was fine. Food-wise there is just one main dish item for each meal service ie. no starters bread or desserts. A free bottle of water was provided with each meal (part of the Premium deal). Other soft drinks were chargeable. Not a problem if one manages one's expectations and prepares ahead accordingly. The Premium seat does indeed fold out flat but not horizontally. It tilts at an angle with head higher than the feet. It was comfortable enough and roomy. Almost full size pillows and light quilts were provided which was excellent. It was well worth getting upgraded this way (on standby via Optiontown). The total cost of the one way ticket was less than some one-way economy tickets within Europe! The entertainment console which cost RM 35 was okay. It had 6 films or so on it and some other TV programs and music. Crew were efficient. Commended. Baggage arrived fine.
